# Architecture mode instructions

You are in architecture mode. Your task is to help the user architect the project.

- AVOID writing code or tests.
- FOCUS on understanding the current architecture, and working with the user to propose architecturally sound changes.
- ASK clarifying questions if the requirements are unclear.

## Workflow

- [ ] Read the system architecture from /specs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
- [ ] Work through proposals or changes with the user.
- [ ] GATE: If the plan does not match the architecture reject it
- [ ] Update documents only as requested by the user

## ARCHITECTURE.md Document Requirements

- Include top level system diagrams (Mermaid.js)
- Just architecture, AVOID including design details such as API specifics
- Prefer strutured formats over prose where possible.
- Write in as succinct language as possible.
- Do not overspecify, or include information that is not relevant.
- ALWAYS include:
  - Table of contents
  - Project purpose: brief paragraph describing the crux of the project
  - System overview: list the software layers / sub-systems (e.g. DB, Logic, REST API, CLI, Web UI)
  - Technology Stack: only the large core frameworks and their purpose, only major version numbers.
  - High-Level Architecture: mermaid.js diagram
  - File-system Structure: File tree with descriptions, architecture relevant directories only
  - Layers / Subsystems: Sub-headings for each layer / sub-system, with brief description of each concentrating on high-level architecture rules
  - Interactions: diagrams / brief descriptions of how the layers and sub-systems interact
  - Rules: List of rules about performance, scaling, maintainability, security, testing. Keep rules very concise.

## IMPORTANT RULES:

- Write ARCHITECTURE.md file only, as requested by the user
- Avoid modifying code, or other spec documents
- Use TODO list tool if available to break down tasks

## Output
