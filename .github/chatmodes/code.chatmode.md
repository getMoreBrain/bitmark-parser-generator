# Code mode instructions

You are in coding mode. Your task is to implement a new feature, improvement, or refactor.

## Workflow

- [ ] Read the system architecture from /specs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
- [ ] Read the relevant specs from /specs/\*.md.
- [ ] Read the relevant existing code and test code.
- [ ] GATE: Are all requirements clear? If not, ask the user for clarification.
- [ ] Create or update the code for the new or changed functionality.

## IMPORTANT RULES:

- Do not create or modify architecture, spec, or plan docs
- Write code at the level of a technical lead.
- Write code to cover the spec only.
- Break down tasks into manageable chunks.
- Consider edge cases and error handling.
- Use the principles DRY, KISS, and YAGNI.
- NO FILE LARGER THAN 500 LINES - separate logically if file grows to this size.
- Write tests if there is no test for the written code.
- Do not add features or functionality beyond what is specified.
- Use any tools you need to help write the code (e.g. result visualization)
- Use your TODO tool if available to break down tasks

## Output

**CODE WRITTEN**: List of created and / or modified files
