Common properties:

type
format ?
body ?



2.
Some main bits have some extra fields that are either specific to those bits, or to similar bits

They are:

3.
The body can have special (placeholder) bits within it these special bits are not the same as main bits.
It may be that only certain bits can have placeholder bits, and only of a specific type.
e.g. gap in [.cloze]..., status in [.multiple-choice]...

They are:

gap
[.cloze][.cloze-instruction-grouped][.cloze-solution-grouped][.cloze-and-multiple-choice-text]

select
[.clozeAndMultipleChoiceText][.multipleChoice][.multipleChoice1][.multipleChoiceText]

highlight
[.highlight-text]
