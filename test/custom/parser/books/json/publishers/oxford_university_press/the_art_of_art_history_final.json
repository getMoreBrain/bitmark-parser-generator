And indeed it is usually precisely the effect of the picture we are really concerned with: it has to be. But terms of this type tend to be a little soft and we sometimes frame our sense of the effect in secondarily indirect ways. One way is by making a comparison, often by metaphor, as in the type at the top: __resonance__ of colour and so on. (One especially bulky sort of comparison, which we tend to work very hard with representational paintings, is to refer to the colours and patterns on the picture surface as if they were the things they are representing, as in Libanius.) And then there is a third type, that on the left.

One way is by making a comparison, often by metaphor, as in the type at the top: __resonance__ of colour and so on. (One especially bulky sort of comparison, which we tend to work very hard with representational paintings, is to refer to the colours and patterns on the picture surface as if they were the things they are representing, as in Libanius.)

Hence we do not merely say of the agreeable that it __pleases__, but that it __gratifies__. I do not accord it a simple approval, but inclination is aroused by it, and where agreeableness is of the liveliest type a judgement on the character of the Object is so entirely out of place, that those who are always intent only on enjoyment (for that is the word used to denote intensity of gratification) would fain dispense with all judgement.",

And, further, if the mind is engaged upon comparisons, we may well suppose that it can in actual fact, though the process is unconscious, superimpose as it were one image upon another, and from the coincidence of a number of the same kind arrive at a mean contour which serves as a common standard for all. Say, for instance, a person has seen a thousand full-grown men. Now if he wishes to judge normal size determined upon a comparative estimate, then imagination (to my mind) allows a great number of these images (perhaps the whole thousand) to fall one upon the other, and, if I may be allowed to extend to the case the analogy of optical presentation, in the space where they come most together, and within the contour where the place is illuminated by the greatest concentration of colour, one gets a perception of the __average size__, which alike in height and breadth is equally removed from the extreme limits of the greatest and smallest statures; and this is the stature of a beautiful man. (The same result could be obtained in a mechanical way, by taking the measures of all the thousand, and adding together their heights, and their breadths (and thicknesses), and dividing the sum in each case by a thousand). But the power of imagination does all this by means of a dynamical effect upon the organ of internal sense, arising from the frequent apprehension of such forms. If, again, for our average man we seek on similar lines for the average head, and for this the average nose, and so on, then we get the figure that underlies the normal idea of a beautiful man in the country where the comparison is instituted. For this reason a negro must necessarily (under these empirical conditions) have a different normal idea of the beauty of forms from what a white man has, and the Chinaman one different from the European. And the process would be just the same with the __model__ of a beautiful horse or dog (of a particular breed).—This __normal idea__ is not derived from proportions taken from experience __as definite rules__: rather is it according to this idea that rules for forming estimates first become possible. It is an intermediate between all singular intuitions of individuals, with their manifold variations—a floating image for the whole genus, which nature has set as an archetype underlying those of her products that belong to the same species, but which in no single case she seems to have completely attained. But the normal idea is far from giving the complete __archetype of beauty__ in the genus. It only gives the form that constitutes the indispensable condition of all beauty, and, consequently, only __correctness__ in the presentation of the genus.

Because the factor of resemblance in signs limits the freedom of the imagination, the imagination is most free and open to play in contemplation of linguistic signs because of their arbitrariness, their noncontingent relation to the natural world, and because the gift of language most clearly marks the abyss separating the human from the instinctual and creaturely. Because of their relation to language, among liberal artists poets are the most free and, in conferring the freedom of the imagination to humanity, are most like God. This relation between God and genius defines the ‘immaculate commerce’ informing Kant’s theory of aesthetic communication, and Derrida recognizes the tautology:",

Just as the inscription of the signature ensures an external authorizing presence within the purportedly pure aesthetic interiority delimited by the frame, the figure of the mouth and the circularity between speech and hearing ensure a passageway between mind and nature, the inside and the outside, subject and object, where heteroaffection and autoaffection fly into and out of one another, gliding on the wings of speech.",

In a simply but elegantly appointed auditorium, two Old Master paintings, in identical gold frames, lean uncertainly against an off-white background.They are neither attached to the space nor hung from it, for their stay here will be a short one. Indeed, they may never be seen again, for although they are too large to fit in your wallet, they will store easily in a vault.They are in transit, and above them hangs a sign not unlike the ones found in railroad stations and airports the world over. It reads ‘Sotheby’s Founded 1744’ and records the value of these works, which shifts second by second, in dollars, pounds, francs, marks, lira, and yen. The caption to this image reads ‘Dede Brooks Makes Her Bid: Sotheby’s president wants her auction house to be a stock exchange for art.’39",

What constitutes horses as horses, then, must be some eternal ‘essence’ of which they partake, and without which they could not keep reappearing with such astonishing fidelity to type. Such Forms were thus in one sense more ‘real’ than their physical ‘manifestations’. This led Plato to devalue art and artifice as the least real or ideal of things, for art was taken by him as an imitation of a ‘pure’ world of Forms or Ideas.1 The ways in which such claims resonate with Christian cosmology founded on a dualism of an ‘immaterial’ and perfect (divine) realm and an imperfect (and mortal) ‘material’ world are obvious.)",

    "bitmark": "[.article:bitmark--]\n[@id:225943]\nOne of the richest motives of the biblical picture-cycle is the __Descent from the Cross,__ an event which sets many hands in movement and contains powerful psychological contrasts. We have the classic version of the theme in Daniele da Volterra’s picture in the Trinità dei Monti in Rome. This has always been admired for the way in which the figures are developed as absolutely independent parts, and yet so work together that each seems governed by the whole. That is precisely renaissance articulation. When later Rubens, as spokesman of the baroque, treats the same subject in an early work, the first point in which he departs from the classic type is the welding of the figures into a homogeneous mass, from which the individual figure can hardly be detached. He makes a mighty stream, reinforced by devices of lighting, pass slanting through the picture from the top.

The effect of words depends on the right choice of the noble or humble term, with all the social and psychological connotations that go with these stratifications. Equal attention should be paid to the flavor of archaic or current usages.4 Either usage can be correct if the topic so demands it.This is the doctrine of __decorum,__ of the  appropriateness of style to the occasion.To use the grand manner for trivial subjects is as ridiculous as to use colloquialisms for solemn occasions (Cicero, __Orator,__ 26). Oratory, in this view, is a skill that slowly developed until it could be used with assurance to sway the jury. But corruption lurks close to perfection. An overdose of effects produces a hollow and affected style that lacks virility. Only a constant study of the greatest models of style (the ‘classical’ authors) will preserve the style pure.5",

The effect of words depends on the right choice of the noble or humble term, with all the social and psychological connotations that go with these stratifications. Equal attention should be paid to the flavor of archaic or current usages.4 Either usage can be correct if the topic so demands it.This is the doctrine of __decorum,__ of the  appropriateness of style to the occasion.To use the grand manner for trivial subjects is as ridiculous as to use colloquialisms for solemn occasions (Cicero, __Orator,__ 26). Oratory, in this view, is a skill that slowly developed until it could be used with assurance to sway the jury. But corruption lurks close to perfection. An overdose of effects produces a hollow and affected style that lacks virility. Only a constant study of the greatest models of style (the ‘classical’ authors) will preserve the style pure.5",

What may appear to one critic as the classic moment of an art may carry, for another, the seeds of corruption, and what looks like the final stage of exhaustion of a style to one interpreter may be seen from another point of view as the groping beginnings of a new style. Cézanne, the complexity of whose art is beyond doubt, saw himself as the primitive of a new age of art, and this ambiguity adheres to any great artist, who can always be described as representing the culmination of a preceding evolution, a new beginning, or (by his adversaries) an archcorruptor. Thus, the naturalism of Jan van Eyck can be seen as the climax of late Gothic tendencies in the descriptive accumulation of minute details20 or as the primitive start of a new era. The style of J. S. Bach can be experienced as late complexity or as archaic grandeur. For the same reasons almost any style can be convincingly described as transitional.",

In that ‘late’ phase, the increasingly hectic search for fresh complexities may lead to an ‘exhaustion’ of the style when all permutations have been tried.19 Although there is a certain superficial plausibility in this interpretation, which accounts for some stretches of historical development, it must never be forgotten that terms such as ‘complexity’ and ‘elements’ do not here refer to measurable entities and that even the relationship of means to ends is open to contrasting interpretations. What may appear to one critic as the classic moment of an art may carry, for another, the seeds of corruption, and what looks like the final stage of exhaustion of a style to one interpreter may be seen from another point of view as the groping beginnings of a new style. Cézanne, the complexity of whose art is beyond doubt, saw himself as the primitive of a new age of art, and this ambiguity adheres to any great artist, who can always be described as representing the culmination of a preceding evolution, a new beginning, or (by his adversaries) an archcorruptor. Thus, the naturalism of Jan van Eyck can be seen as the climax of late Gothic tendencies in the descriptive accumulation of minute details20 or as the primitive start of a new era. The style of J. S. Bach can be experienced as late complexity or as archaic grandeur. For the same reasons almost any style can be convincingly described as transitional.",

The first concerns the ‘feedback’ character of social theories. Soviet Russia, having adopted the Marxist version of Hegelianism as its official creed, could not look at any artistic utterance but as a necessary expression of a social situation. Deviation and nonconformity in art were therefore bound to be interpreted as symptoms of potential disloyalty, and a monolithic style appealing to the majority became a theoretical necessity.We in the West, happily, do not suffer from the same state religion, but the Hegelian conviction is still sufficiently widespread among critics and politicians to encourage a political interpretation of stylistic changes — our newspapers prefer to ask of every new movement in art or architecture what it stands for, rather than what its artistic potentialities may be.

      "body": "There are perhaps two lessons which the student of style can learn from this example. The first concerns the ‘feedback’ character of social theories. Soviet Russia, having adopted the Marxist version of Hegelianism as its official creed, could not look at any artistic utterance but as a necessary expression of a social situation. Deviation and nonconformity in art were therefore bound to be interpreted as symptoms of potential disloyalty, and a monolithic style appealing to the majority became a theoretical necessity.We in the West, happily, do not suffer from the same state religion, but the Hegelian conviction is still sufficiently widespread among critics and politicians to encourage a political interpretation of stylistic changes — our newspapers prefer to ask of every new movement in art or architecture what it stands for, rather than what its artistic potentialities may be.

I believe it is because both ‘idealism’ and ‘materialism’ as a priori bases of historical investigation demand the suppression of one or another kind of historical evidence. Idealism and materialism are alternative principles of the highest generality.

Rhythm, however, as long as it appears to be evident for the beholder is necessarily bound to the plane.Rhythm exists from elements beside and above one another, but not behind one another; in the latter case, individual shapes and parts would overlap and thus withdraw themselves from the immediate visual perception of the beholder. Hence, an art which wants to present units in a rhythmic composition is forced to compose on the plane and to avoid deep space. As all ancient art, so also late Roman art strove for the representation of individual unifying shapes via a rhythmic composition on the plane.",

Indeed, the late antique tendency toward magic was a detour. However, the necessity of this detour becomes clear as soon as one realizes that it was not the product of a specific scientific theory, but came from the abolition of a thousand-year-old notion which all antiquity held in common and which conceived the world composed of mechanistic self-contained and individual shapes. The necessary preconditions of this change were the erosion of faith in a purely mechanistic structure as much as the rise of a new, positive faith in the relationship of objects, which went beyond mechanics, but was still based on individual shapes and in that sense magic. Just when this new faith was bearing permanent fruits, the idea of a mechanistic connection (never completely forgotten by the inhabitants of the West) regained its rightful status (in the visual arts just as much as in the conception of the world). There was no longer a danger of falling back on the notion of an exclusively mechanistic connection and of unchangeable individual shapes. The notion of an extra-mechanistic connection among all things of creation had meanwhile become firmly rooted in the mind of the West, as had, to be the basic elements in art, the perception of mass composition (in place of the individuality of material shapes) and deep space (in place of a plane on which is disposed a sequence of individual shapes).The development of European culture, which occupies a leading place in the world, owes both concepts to the late Roman period.15",

In the northwestern part of the plateau, in the state of Colorado, are the now abandoned cliff-dwellings: houses built into clefts of rock. The eastern group consists of approximately eighteen villages, all relatively accessible from Santa Fe and Albuquerque.The especially important villages of the Zuñi lie more to the southwest and can be reached in a day’s journey from Fort Wingate. The hardest to reach — and therefore the most undisturbed in the preservation of ancient ways — are the villages of the Moki (Hopi), six in all, rising out of three parallel ridges of rock."

Yet it is patently contradictory to applaud a scholar’s innovative approach to art as a form of material culture, while simultaneously extricating his interests in Indians from the popular culture of his own day, where romanticizing notions of ‘noble savages’ resonate with his own mindset. The question goes to the heart of the contemporary concern with a critical understanding of the institutional origins of art history. In that regard, those aspects of Warburg’s work that are no longer tenable need to be scrutinized __alongside__ those aspects that still appear to be; anything less would be a mark of profound disrespect to a remarkable scholar.",

The reference to cannibalism is suppressed, but not excluded altogether, since the head on the ground, conveniently cut off at the neck by the frame, refers discreetly to the dismemberment described elsewhere in the text, in the following unillustrated chapter on ceremonies of war, which precedes the chapter on religious rites.",

Such bitter disputes broke out between the Calvinist and Catholic factions in Brazil that de Léry sought shelter with the Tupinamba while he waited for a ship to take him home in 1558. Th e bitter dispute continued in Europe, where the main participants published rival accounts of the conflict between the Catholic and Huguenot missionaries and the Tupinamba. De Léry first drafted his in Geneva in 1563 but, due to his involvement in the Huguenot resistance, it did not appear in print until 1578.",

It was a revision of an essay published in Germany in 1932, the year before Panofsky migrated to the USA. Panofsky was concerned with the meaning, subject matter, or content of works of art, in reaction to what he and his associates in the early decades of the twentieth century (including art historians Aby Warburg, Fritz Saxl, and historian and philosopher Ernst Cassirer) perceived as too great a preoccupation with the formal qualities of objects (in their view the ‘formalist’ work of Wölfflin and Riegl). The disciplinary opposition between ‘form and meaning’ was treated in Panofsky’s methodological hypotheses not as oppositional but rather as continuous, and as complex and multilayered. His aim was to render less impressionistic and naturalistic, and also considerably more complex, the processes of signification or meaning construction, suggesting an ideal set of procedures we commonly undertake in attributing meaningfulness to objects. Meaning is layered because our knowledge of the world is itself a process of apprehension that unfolds over time. Even if that time factor is near instantaneous, the steps to understanding corresponded, for Panofsky, to different modes or forms of knowledge.

Yet all the qualities which this mental portrait would show explicitly are implicitly inherent in every single action; so that, conversely, every single action can be interpreted in the light of those qualities.",

In doing this we connect artistic motifs and combinations of artistic motifs (compositions) with themes or concepts.

If the knife that enables us to identify a St. Bartholomew is not a knife but a corkscrew, the figure is not a St. Bartholomew.

From a compositional point of view this change means, roughly speaking, the substitution of a triangular scheme for a rectangular one; from an iconographical point of view, it means the introduction of a new theme to be formulated in writing by such authors as Pseudo-Bonaventure and St. Bridget. But at the same time it reveals a new emotional attitude peculiar to the later phases of the Middle Ages. A really exhaustive interpretation of the intrinsic meaning or content might even show that the technical procedures characteristic of a certain country, period, or artist, for instance Michelangelo’s preference for sculpture in stone instead of in bronze, or the peculiar use of hatchings in his drawings, are symptomatic of the same basic attitude that is discernible in all the other specific qualities of his style. In thus conceiving of pure forms, motifs, images, stories and allegories as manifestations of underlying principles, we interpret all these elements as what Ernst Cassirer has called ‘symbolical’ values. As long as we limit ourselves to stating that Leonardo da Vinci’s famous fresco shows a group of thirteen men around a dinner table, and that this group of men represents the Last Supper, we deal with the work of art as such, and we interpret its compositional and iconographical features as its own properties or qualifications. But __when we try to understand it as a document of Leonardo’s personality, or of the civilization of the Italian High Renaissance, or of a peculiar religious attitude__, we deal with the __work of art as a symptom of something else which expresses itself in a countless variety of other symptoms, and we interpret its compositional and iconographical features as more particularized evidence of this ‘something else.’__ The discovery and interpretation of these ‘symbolical’ values (which are often unknown to the artist himself and may even emphatically differ from what he consciously intended to express) is the object of what we may call __‘iconology’__ as opposed to ‘iconography.’",

But what about the sword? Salome did not decapitate St. John the Baptist with her own hands. Now the Bible tells us about another handsome woman in connection with the decapitation of a man, namely Judith. In this case the situation is exactly reversed. Th e sword in Maffei’s picture would be correct because Judith beheaded Holofernes with her own hand, but the charger would not agree with the Judith theme because the text explicitly states that the head of Holofernes was put into a sack. Thus we have two literary sources applicable to our picture with equal right and equal inconsistency. If we should interpret it as a portrayal of Salome the text would account for the charger, but not for the sword; if we should interpret it as a portrayal of Judith the text would account for the sword, but not for the charger. We should be entirely at a loss were we to depend on the literary sources alone. Fortunately we do not. As we could supplement and correct our practical experience by inquiring into the manner in which, under varying historical conditions, objects and events were expressed by forms, viz., into the history of style, just so can we supplement and correct our knowledge of literary sources by inquiring into the manner in which, under varying historical conditions, specific themes or concepts were expressed by objects and events, viz., into the history of types.",

Interdisciplinary research poses specific problems of methodology, which have to do with the status of the objects and the applicability of concepts designed to account for objects with a different status. Thus a concept mainly discussed in literary theory—for example, metaphor—is relevant to the analysis of visual art, and refusing to use it amounts to an unwarranted decision to take all images as literal expressions. But such use requires a thinking-through of the status of signs and meaning in visual art—for example, of the delimitation of discrete signs in a medium that is supposed to be given over to density. 12 Rather than borrowing the concept of metaphor from literary theory, then, an art historian will take it out of its unwarranted confinement within that specific discipline and first examine the extent to which metaphor, as a phenomenon of transfer of meaning from one sign onto another, should be generalized. This is the case here, but not all concepts from literature lend themselves to such generalization. Rhythm and rhyme, for example, although often used apropos visual images, are more medium-specific and their use for images is therefore more obviously metaphorical. Semiotics offers a theory and a set of analytic tools that are not bound to a particular object domain. Thus it liberates the analyst from the problem that transferring concepts from one discipline into another entails. Recent attempts to connect verbal and visual arts, for example, tend to suffer from unreflected transfers, or they painstakingly translate the concepts of the one discipline into the other, inevitably importing a hierarchy between them. Semiotics, by virtue of its supradisciplinary status, can be brought to bear on objects pertaining to any sign-system. That semiotics has been primarily developed in conjunction with literary texts is perhaps largely a historical accident, whose consequences, while not unimportant, can be bracketed.13 As a supradisciplinary theory, semiotics lends itself to interdisciplinary analyses, for example, of word and image relations, which seek to avoid both the erection of hierarchies and the eclectic transferring of concepts.14 But the use of semiotics is not limited to interdisciplinarity. Its multidisciplinary reach — as journals like __Semiotica__ demonstrate, it can be used in a variety of disciplines — has made semiotics an appropriate tool for monodisciplinary analysis as well.

This is not, however, tantamount to making the exploration of meaning a pursuit of wild, subjective fantasy. It is in the nature of works of art themselves that they should support and favor the process of interpretation. To pursue meaning is not like a game of Chinese boxes, where we open one at a time until we find what is bound to be the smallest and most secret box in the center. It is certainly a process in which one problem solved discloses another, but the movement is outwards, in the social dimension, rather than inwards, converging on a private truth. The semiologist Jan Mukarovsky effectively defined the issue by stating that every work of art has two components, the ‘work-thing’ (which we can touch, purchase, and have restored) and the ‘aesthetic object’ which is ‘laid down in the collective consciousness’ (Mukarovsky 1988, 7). To interpret the aesthetic object is inevitably to measure its participation in the multiple codes which govern the collective consciousness.",

This is not, however, tantamount to making the exploration of meaning a pursuit of wild, subjective fantasy. It is in the nature of works of art themselves that they should support and favor the process of interpretation. To pursue meaning is not like a game of Chinese boxes, where we open one at a time until we find what is bound to be the smallest and most secret box in the center. It is certainly a process in which one problem solved discloses another, but the movement is outwards, in the social dimension, rather than inwards, converging on a private truth. The semiologist Jan Mukarovsky effectively defined the issue by stating that every work of art has two components, the ‘work-thing’ (which we can touch, purchase, and have restored) and the ‘aesthetic object’ which is ‘laid down in the collective consciousness’ (Mukarovsky 1988, 7). To interpret the aesthetic object is inevitably to measure its participation in the multiple codes which govern the collective consciousness.",

First of all, as has been shown, she had no direct acquaintance with Elsheimer. She may well have been acquainted with Goudt, who knew Elsheimer well enough to share a house with him and commission works from him, though the equivocal nature of their relationship is conveyed by Sandrart’s claim that the painter was put into a debtor’s prison because of his inability to complete the Dutchman’s commissions (Andrews 1977, 56). She may well have accepted a title given by Goudt and seen no reason to check on the details of the Ovidian myth. What can be asserted without fear of contradiction is the fact that the Latin verses bring out the particular feature which, in representations of the Death of Procris, made such works appropriate for marriage gifts and wedding celebrations: reinterpreted as a Death of Procris, and glossed by the moralistic verses, it could be placed among ‘the class of images that functioned as examples of wifely virtue or of the consequences of inappropriate behaviour’ (Fermor 1993, 51). Is it permissible to move in this way from a Renaissance painting, destined perhaps for a bridal chamber, to an engraving, whose decorative impact would, under any circumstances, have been much less significant? Is Magdalena de Passe uninterested in the subject and content with a text which at least constrains the iconography within a simple, moralistic theme, and may to some extent perhaps improve its salability among her Calvinist compatriots? The answer cannot be given unequivocally, and perhaps it is also impossible to get much further in assessing the stake of this dutiful daughter and (if the print dates from after 1624) wife in a representation of femininity which differs significantly from the one which Elsheimer intended. The mixture of history and speculation which has led to her immediate contemporary, the Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi, being credited with a direct subjective investment in the scene of male decapitation which she constructs __(Judith and Holofernes)__ is inappropriate here (see Menzio 1979, 17–43).

Both in Apollo and Coronis and in his repeated subject of __Tobias and the Angel__ Elsheimer concerns himself with the arts of medicine. In the former, he conjures up the circumstances for the birth of the god of healing, while in the latter he takes an obscure story from the Apocrypha, of a son who cures his father with the liver of a miraculous fish. To presuppose that Elsheimer was attentive to these fables of healing is not necessarily to assume that he had a personal psychological investment in this beneficent theme. It is also possible, for example, that he had friends, or even patrons, in professional medical circles. What may be the most attractive idea to pursue, elsewhere than here, is the possibility that he saw in the long, laborious work of painting his tiny images, and in the quasi-alchemical preparation of his pigments, a powerful and congenial analogy to the arts of healing: these would indeed be images to heal and save.

In this sense the work of art is also a thing, so far as it is not simply nothing. Yet this concept is of no use to us, at least immediately, in our attempt to delimit entities that have the mode of being of a thing, as against those having the mode of being of a work. And besides, we hesitate to call God a thing. In the same way we hesitate to consider the peasant in the field, the stoker at the boiler, the teacher in the school as things. A man is not a thing. It is true that we speak of a young girl who is faced with a task too difficult for her as being a young thing, still too young for it, but only because we feel that being human is in a certain way missing here and think that instead we have to do here with the factor that constitutes the thingly character of things. We hesitate even to call the deer in the forest clearing, the beetle in the grass, the blade of grass a thing. We would sooner think of a hammer as a thing, or a shoe, or an ax, or a clock.

Death and judgment — these are ultimate things. On the whole the word ‘thing’ here designates whatever is not simply nothing. In this sense the work of art is also a thing, so far as it is not simply nothing. Yet this concept is of no use to us, at least immediately, in our attempt to delimit entities that have the mode of being of a thing, as against those having the mode of being of a work. And besides, we hesitate to call God a thing. In the same way we hesitate to consider the peasant in the field, the stoker at the boiler, the teacher in the school as things. A man is not a thing. It is true that we speak of a young girl who is faced with a task too difficult for her as being a young thing, still too young for it, but only because we feel that being human is in a certain way missing here and think that instead we have to do here with the factor that constitutes the thingly character of things. We hesitate even to call the deer in the forest clearing, the beetle in the grass, the blade of grass a thing. We would sooner think of a hammer as a thing, or a shoe, or an ax, or a clock. But even these are not mere things. Only a stone, a clod of earth, a piece of wood are for us such mere things. Lifeless beings of nature and objects of use. Natural things and utensils are the things commonly so called.",

Though he credits to art the power of giving to a represented pair of shoes that explicit appearance in which their being is disclosed — indeed ‘the universal essence of things’, ‘world and earth in their counterplay’—this concept of the metaphysical power of art remains here a theoretical idea.12 Th e example on which he elaborates with strong conviction does not support that idea.",

For even if he had seen a picture of a peasant woman’s shoes, as he describes them, it would be a mistake to suppose that the truth he uncovered in the painting — the being of the shoes—is something given here once and for all and is unavailable to our perception of shoes outside the painting. I find nothing in Heidegger’s fanciful description of the shoes represented by van Gogh that could not have been imagined in looking at a real pair of peasants’ shoes. Though he credits to art the power of giving to a represented pair of shoes that explicit appearance in which their being is disclosed — indeed ‘the universal essence of things’, ‘world and earth in their counterplay’—this concept of the metaphysical power of art remains here a theoretical idea.12 Th e example on which he elaborates with strong conviction does not support that idea.",

They are not less objectively rendered for being seen as if endowed with his feelings and revery about himself. In isolating his own worn shoes on a canvas, he turns them to the spectator; he makes of them a piece from a self-portrait, that part of the costume with which we tread the earth and in which we locate the strains of movement, fatigue, pressure, heaviness — the burden of the erect body in its contact with the ground. They mark our inescapable position on the earth. To ‘be in someone’s shoes’ is to be in his predicament or his station in life.

A fair number of difficulties arise from what is translated by illustration. In his protocol, Schapiro uses this word which also translates [into French] ‘__bildliche Darstellung__’ [‘For this purpose an illustration suffices. We choose for this a famous picture by van Gogh…’]. Schapiro opens his text— and T__he Origin__ — at this point [by what right?] and he writes: ‘In his essay on __The Origin of the Work of Art__, Martin Heidegger interprets a painting by van Gogh to illustrate the nature of art as a disclosure of truth."

To prove this, one has no need to refer to what the following page says, i.e., [in translation first]: ‘the work in no way served [__diente gar nicht__], as it may have seemed at first, to illustrate more clearly what a product is.’ What has here been translated as ‘illustrate’ is __Veranschaulichung__ this time, and not Darstellung, which was also translated above as illustration. __Veranschaulichung__, intuitive presentation, as it were, is what had to be facilitated by invoking the example of the picture.

    "bitmark": "[.article:bitmark--]\n[@id:226588]\nHeidegger goes on: ‘and of being made. The naked thing [__blosse Ding__] is a sort of product [Zeug] but a product divested [__entkleidete__] of its being-as-product. Being-thing then consists in what still remains [__was noch übrigbleibt__]. But this remainder [__Rest__] is not properly [__eigens__] determined in itself.…’\n—The remainder: these naked shoes, these things of uncertain use, returned to their abandonment as things for doing nothing.\n—Perhaps saying that still involves thinking of them too much in terms of their use-value. In order to think this ‘remainder’ and ‘properly’ [__eigens__] otherwise, Heidegger then takes another step. He wants to interpret the being-product without or before the matter-form couple, convinced that this remainder will not be reached by subtraction of the ‘product’ but by opening up another road toward what is properly product in the product, toward the ‘__Zeughaften des Zeuges__.’ The reference to van Gogh is inscribed in this movement, in whatever makes it very strictly singular. That said, inside this movement, Heidegger’s gesture, with all the craftsmanlike subtlety of a cobbler with a short awl, going quickly from inside to outside, speaks now of the picture, in it, now of something quite different, outside it. In a first movement and most importantly, the question which provokes the reference to the picture in no way concerns a work of art. In a manner of speaking the primary motivation of the passage does not concern painting. And yet, through this lacing movement we were talking about (from inside to outside, from outside to inside, his iron point passing through the surface of the leather or the canvas in both directions, pricking and pointing [__par piqûre et pointure__]), the trajectory of the reference is divided and multiplied. In a way which is doubtless both wily and naïve, but following a necessity which Schapiro’s lawsuit seems to me to overlook.\n—is it a matter of rendering justice to Heidegger, of restituting what is his due, his truth, the possibility of his own gait and progress?\n—This question comes a little too early. I’m only starting.[…]\n—I always get the impression that in commenting on Heidegger, in restituting him in an apparently very strict way, one makes him say something quite other, all the accents are changed, his language is no longer recognizable. The commentary becomes obscene and thinking otherwise becomes thinking otherwise than he, who wants to think the remainder ‘properly.’ Here, ‘otherwise’ would be otherwise than properly. But then what would be proper to this other?\n—Let us rather return to the ‘famous picture.’ A product-thing, some shoes, is there as if represented (Heidegger will, moreover, say that it is not represented, re-produced, but let’s leave these questions for the moment, we shall pick them up again). This ‘product’ has at least the following singular characteristics that we can point out immediately: It belongs to the genus ‘clothing’ (and is in this sense parergonal), and this is not the case with all products. It hints at a movement of return to the thing that is said, by metaphor or transference, to be ‘naked’: insofar as it is a useless product, not in current use, abandoned, unlaced, offered, as thing (1 and 3) and as product (thing 2) in a sort of idleness [__désoeuvrement__]. And yet, insofar as it is a usable product, and especially insofar as it is a product of the genus clothing, it is invested, inhabited, informed\n—haunted\n—by the ‘form’ of another naked thing from which it is (partially and provisionally?) detached\n—‘the parergon is detached…’\n—and to which it seems to be waiting (seems to make us wait for it) to be reattached, reappropriated. It seems to be made to be retied. But the line of detachment (and thus of the out-of-use and the idleness alike) is not only the one which goes around the shoes and thus gives them form, cuts them out. This first line is already a tracing of coming and going between the outside and the inside, notably when it follows the movement of the lace. It is therefore not simple, it has an internal border and an external border which is incessantly turned back in. But there is another line, another system of detaching traits: this is the work qua picture in its frame. The frame makes a work of supplementary __désoeuvrement__. It cuts out but also sews back together. By an invisible lace which pierces the canvas (as the pointure ‘pierces the paper’), passes into it then out of it in order to sew it back onto its milieu, onto its internal and external worlds. From then on, if these shoes are no longer useful, it is of course because they are detached from naked feet and from their subject of reattachment (their owner, usual holder, the one who wears them and whom they bear). It is also because they are painted: within the limits of a picture, but limits that have to be thought in laces. __Hors-d’oeuvre__ in the __oeuvre, hors-d’oeuvre as oeuvre__: the laces go through the eyelets (which also go in pairs) and pass on to the invisible side. And when they come back from it, do they emerge from the other side of the leather or the other side of the canvas? Th e prick of their iron point, through the metal-edged eyelets, pierces the leather and the canvas simultaneously. How can we distinguish the two textures of invisibility from each other? Piercing them with a single __pointure__\n—So there’d be __pointure__ of the laces, in this other sense—\n—piercing them with a single __pointure__\n—does the __pointure__ belong to the picture? I’m thinking of the points that nail the canvas onto the stretcher. When nails are painted (as they are by Klee in his Constructif-impressionnant of 1927), as figure on a ground, what is their place? To what system do they belong?\n—the nails do not form part of the ‘principal’ figure, as the laces do. The functioning of their __pointure__ requires another analysis—\n—piercing them with a single __pointure__, the figure of the laces will have sewn the leather onto the canvas. If the two textures are traversed by a single doubled blow, then they are henceforth indiscernible. Everything is painted on leather, the canvas is both shod [chaussée] and unshod, etc. That is how it appears, at least, in this play of appearance/disappearance. […]\n—I’ll sharpen up the question: to a peasant or a peasant woman? It’s the limen of this debate, let’s remain there a little longer: why does Heidegger sometimes say ‘a pair of peasants’ shoes [__ein Paar Bauernschuhe__] and nothing else [__und nichts weiter__],’ without determination of sex or allowing the masculine to gain a footing thanks to this neutrality, and sometimes—more often, in fact—‘the peasant woman’ [__die Bäuerin__], when designating the ‘subject’? He never explains himself on this point, and Schapiro, for his part, never pays the slightest attention to it. To which sex are these shoes due? This is not exactly the same question as that posed earlier, when we were wondering whether or not there was a symbolic equivalence between the supposed ‘symbol’ ‘shoe’ and such-and-such a genital organ, or whether only a differential and idiomatic syntax could arrest bisexuality, confer on it some particular leading or dominant value, etc. Here it is not the same question and yet the attribution of shoes (in painting) to a subject-wearer (bearer)\n—of shoes and of a sex\n—a masculine or feminine sex, this attribution is not without its resonance with the first question. Let us not forget that __The Origin__ deals with the essence of truth, the truth of essence and the abyss [__Abgrund__] which plays itself out there like the ‘veiled’ destiny [__fatum__] which transfixes being.",

So let’s read once more the opening of this passage. It is indeed a question of ‘simply describing’ [__einfach beschreiben__] not a picture but ‘a product,’ ‘without philosophical theory.’ ‘We choose as an example a common sort of product: a pair of peasants’ shoes.’ Not yet a picture, not a work of art, but a product. Let’s go on. ‘In order to describe them, we do not need to have in front of us real samples of useful objects of this type. Everyone is familiar with them. But since it is a matter here of an immediate description, it maybe as well to facilitate intuitive presentation [__Veranschaulichung__]. By way of an accessory aid [__Für diese Nachhilfe__, omitted in the French (and English) translation], a pictorial representation [__bildliche Darstellung__] suffices. For this purpose we choose a famous picture by van Gogh who painted such shoes more than once.’\n—It’s clear, the picture is, for the moment, as a hypothesis, an intuitive accessory. One can reproach Heidegger for this illustrative procedure, but that would be a different matter from behaving as though he were trying to describe the picture for itself, and then, in this hypothesis which for the moment is not his, reproaching him for mistakes in the reading. For the moment, the object to be described, to be interpreted, is not the picture or even the object insofar as it is painted (__[re]presented__), but a familiar product well known to everyone. None of what follows concerns, or pretends to delimit, the pictorial specificity of the shoes or even their specificity insofar as they may be different from other shoes. With a picture in front of you to keep up attention and facilitate intuition, a picture of a pair of shoes, whatever pair it may be, peasants’ shoes or not, painted or not, you could bring out the same features: the being-product, the usefulness, the belonging to the world and to the earth, in the very definite sense that Heidegger accords to these two words which do not interest Schapiro and to which we shall have to return. But in that case, you’ll say, why choose a painting? Why explicate so heavily what stems from the problematical identification of these shoes as peasants’ shoes? At the stage where we are at the moment, and Heidegger says so, some real shoes (peasants’ or not) or shoes drawn vaguely in chalk on the blackboard would have rendered the same service. The blackboard would have sufficed.\n—That’s what Schapiro reproaches Heidegger with.\n—But Heidegger says it (‘But what more is there to see there? Everybody knows what belongs to shoes’), and you can only reproach him for it by assuming that he was primarily interested in a picture, that he was trying to analyze it as such, which is not the case. For the use to which he wanted to put it at first, the various canvases were indeed interchangeable, with no harm done. If his attribution of the thing to peasantry is indeed (and we shall still have to examine to what point it is) imprudent and precipitate, we do at least know that he could have produced, for what mattered to the analysis of the being-product, the same discourse on town shoes: the relationship of the wearer to this strange product (very close to, and yet detachable from, his body), the relationship with walking, with work, with the ground, the earth, and the world. Everything that comes down to the ‘peasant’ world is in this respect an accessory variable even if it does come massively under ‘projection’ and answers to Heidegger’s pathetic-fantasmatic-ideological-political investments.",

Everything that comes down to the ‘peasant’ world is in this respect an accessory variable even if it does come massively under ‘projection’ and answers to Heidegger’s pathetic-fantasmatic-ideological-political investments.",

He also attributes the painted shoes, without the slightest examination, to peasantry, or even to the peasant woman. This attribution appears to be incompatible with what he says further on against imitation, copy, representative reproduction, etc., against the notion of adequation or __homoiosis__. For example: ‘Or else would the proposition according to which art is the putting-itself-to-work of truth give new life to a fortunately outdated opinion according to which art is an imitation or a descriptive copy of the real? The replica of the given doubtless demands conformity with being, a regulated measuring against it; __adaequatio__, say the Middle Ages, όμοίωσις said Aristotle already. For a long time, conformity with being has been considered to be equivalent to the essence of truth. But do we really believe that this picture by van Gogh copies [__male ab__, depicta] a given [present, __vorhandenes__] pair of peasants’ shoes, and that it is a work because it has succeeded in doing so? Do we wish to say that the picture has taken a copy of the real and that it has transformed the real into a product [__Produkt__] of artistic production? Nowise.’ This reply [‘__Nowise__’] also holds, in the next paragraph, for the reproduction of a general essence which some tried to substitute for the singular given, keeping the same schema. Now I understand well enough how that hits Schapiro’s preoccupations and disqualifies his assurances (Schapiro who seems to believe in the reproduction of ‘given’ shoes, those of van Gogh and even of a ‘given’ van Gogh, in a given time and place, ‘by that time a man of the town and city’!), and I also understand well enough how the proof itself is in this case __a priori__ irrelevant. But what I do not understand is why Heidegger should escape from the same suspicion, from his own suspicion basically, from the moment he says, without proof this time, without even looking for a proof: they are peasants’ shoes. He does not even say they are in order to reply to a possible question, he names them, __‘Ein Paar Bauernschuhe,’__ without even imagining the first murmur of a question.\n—That’s the whole dissymmetry, the innocent outbidding of this correspondence. One claim is more naïve, more excessive, if one can say that, than the other. One attribution exceeds the other. Imagine an auctioneer who is both an expert and a buyer, pushing up the bidding in the empty room. Bidding for second-hand, more or less unmatched shoes on a framed canvas. On the one hand, Schapiro’s attribution remains in the aesthetics of representation, and even of the most empiricist kind: either short of (precritical), or going beyond (excessive), the movement carried out by __The Origin__ in the passage just translated. But on his side, by saying __‘Bauernschuhe’__ without asking himself any questions about this, Heidegger falls short of his discourse on the truth in painting, and is even more naïve than Schapiro. Excessive to the extent of talking about peasants’ shoes even before any question of ‘representation,’ and already in the order of a ‘presentative’ truth. The fact is that the step backwards from a truth of adequation to a truth of unveiling, whatever its necessity and its ‘critical’ force, can also leave one practically disarmed in the face of the ingenuous, the precritical, the dogmatic, in the face of any ‘preinvestment’ (be it ‘fantasmatic,’ ‘ideological,’ etc., or whatever name you call it). Th ere’s a law here. This is perhaps one of the secrets of this correspondence, of its dissymmetry or its excessive symmetry: in the contract of truth (‘I owe you the truth in painting’), between truth as adequation (of a representation, here an attributive one, on Schapiro’s side) and the truth of unveiled presence (Heidegger’s side). For the moment let us leave this truth contract, between the two truths. (What is doing the contracting there has to do with a trait [__Riss__] and an attraction [attrait] [__Zug__] of the work, with a __Gezüge__, which will draw us much further into Heidegger’s text.) The truth of the shoes as things due (the object of the subject) constrains this correspondence and we ought (supposing one ever has to ought) to reexamine its terms later. One of the innumerable difficulties in reading __The Origin__ and especially this passage, is that of grasping the furtive moment when a certain line is crossed, and of grasping too the step with which it is crossed.\n—In the sense of __über die Linie__ [__trans linear or de linear__] and of the topology of being in __Zur Seinsfragel__\n—No. Well, yes. But this connection passes through detours we don’t have time for here. Or space. I was simply designating, close at hand here, the crossing of certain lines, of certain traits in the picture (the outline of the ‘product,’ for example the line of the collar or the line of the lace). And above all, first of all, the crossing of the lines of framing, the traits which detach the picture from the real milieu. Where, at what moment, in what direction [__sens__] does this transgression take place? And is this crossing a transgression? Transgression of what law? Which comes down to wondering notably whether and within what limits Heidegger intended to speak of the ‘famous picture.’\n—Which one?\n—We don’t know yet. We have verified that at the precise moment when in this chapter he takes the example of a pair of peasants’ shoes, no picture has yet been necessary. None has even been invoked. And it’s been going on like that for several pages. Now even at the moment when the ‘famous picture’ provides what is basically an example of an example, its status leaves us in a definitive uncertainty. We can always say, challenging proof to be produced, that Heidegger does not intend to speak of the picture, does not describe it as such, and passes regularly from an example of a product (peasants’ shoes) to the example of the example (some particular shoes in some particular picture), in both directions, then from exemplarity to the being-product, picking out the predicates of the being-product and letting the others drop\n—like old shoes.",

Now even at the moment when the ‘famous picture’ provides what is basically an example of an example, its status leaves us in a definitive uncertainty. We can always say, challenging proof to be produced, that Heidegger does not intend to speak of the picture, does not describe it as such, and passes regularly from an example of a product (peasants’ shoes) to the example of the example (some particular shoes in some particular picture), in both directions, then from exemplarity to the being-product, picking out the predicates of the being-product and letting the others drop\n—like old shoes.",

    "bitmark": "[.article:bitmark--]\n[@id:226618]\nThe second theme is even more familiar: it is the kinship between writing and death. This relationship inverts the age-old conception of Greek narrative or epic, which was designed to guarantee the immortality of a hero. The hero accepted an early death because his life, consecrated and magnified by death, passed into immortality; and the narrative redeemed his acceptance of death. In a different sense, Arabic stories, and __The Arabian Nights__ in particular, had as their motivation, their theme and pretext, this strategy for defeating death. Storytellers continued their narratives late into the night to forestall death and to delay the inevitable moment when everyone must fall silent. Scheherazade’s story is a desperate inversion of murder; it is the effort, throughout all those nights, to exclude death from the circle of existence.9 This conception of a spoken or written narrative as a protection against death has been transformed by our culture. Writing is now linked to sacrifice and to the sacrifice of life itself; it is a voluntary obliteration of the self that does not require representation in books because it takes place in the everyday existence of the writer. Where a work had the duty of creating immortality, it now attains the right to kill, to become the murderer of its author. Flaubert, Proust, and Kafka are obvious examples of this reversal.10 In addition, we find the link between writing and death manifested in the total effacement of the individual characteristics of the writer; the quibbling and confrontations that a writer generates between himself and his text cancel out the signs of his particular individuality. If we wish to know the writer in our day, it will be through the singularity of his absence and in his link to death, which has transformed him into a victim of his own writing. While all of this is familiar in philosophy, as in literary criticism, I am not certain that the consequences derived from the disappearance or death of the author have been fully explored or that the importance of this event has been appreciated. To be specific, it seems to me that the themes destined to replace the privileged position accorded the author have merely served to arrest the possibility of genuine change. Of these, I will examine two that seem particularly important.\n||existence.9, reversal.10 - footnotes||",

      "body": "The second theme is even more familiar: it is the kinship between writing and death. This relationship inverts the age-old conception of Greek narrative or epic, which was designed to guarantee the immortality of a hero. The hero accepted an early death because his life, consecrated and magnified by death, passed into immortality; and the narrative redeemed his acceptance of death. In a different sense, Arabic stories, and __The Arabian Nights__ in particular, had as their motivation, their theme and pretext, this strategy for defeating death. Storytellers continued their narratives late into the night to forestall death and to delay the inevitable moment when everyone must fall silent. Scheherazade’s story is a desperate inversion of murder; it is the effort, throughout all those nights, to exclude death from the circle of existence.9 This conception of a spoken or written narrative as a protection against death has been transformed by our culture. Writing is now linked to sacrifice and to the sacrifice of life itself; it is a voluntary obliteration of the self that does not require representation in books because it takes place in the everyday existence of the writer. Where a work had the duty of creating immortality, it now attains the right to kill, to become the murderer of its author. Flaubert, Proust, and Kafka are obvious examples of this reversal.10 In addition, we find the link between writing and death manifested in the total effacement of the individual characteristics of the writer; the quibbling and confrontations that a writer generates between himself and his text cancel out the signs of his particular individuality. If we wish to know the writer in our day, it will be through the singularity of his absence and in his link to death, which has transformed him into a victim of his own writing. While all of this is familiar in philosophy, as in literary criticism, I am not certain that the consequences derived from the disappearance or death of the author have been fully explored or that the importance of this event has been appreciated. To be specific, it seems to me that the themes destined to replace the privileged position accorded the author have merely served to arrest the possibility of genuine change. Of these, I will examine two that seem particularly important.",

Their anonymity was ignored because their real or supposed age was a sufficient guarantee of their authenticity. Texts, however, that we now call ‘scientific’ (dealing with cosmology and the heavens, medicine or illness, the natural sciences or geography) were only considered truthful during the Middle Ages if the name of the author was indicated. Statements on the order of ‘Hippocrates said …’ or ‘Pliny tells us that …’ were not merely formulas for an argument based on authority; they marked a proven discourse. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a totally new conception was developed when scientific texts were accepted on their own merits and positioned within an anonymous and coherent conceptual system of established truths and methods of verification. Authentification no longer required reference to the individual who had produced them; the role of the author disappeared as an index of truthfulness and, where it remained as an inventor’s name, it was merely to denote a specific theorem or proposition, a strange effect, a property, a body, a group of elements, or pathological syndrome.",

Modern criticism, in its desire to ‘recover’ the author from a work, employs devices strongly reminiscent of Christian exegesis when it wished to prove the value of a text by ascertaining the holiness of its author. In __De Viris Illustribus__, Saint Jerome maintains that homonymy is not proof of the common authorship of several works, since many individuals could have the same name or someone could have perversely appropriated another’s name. The name, as an individual mark, is not sufficient as it relates to a textual tradition. How, then, can several texts be attributed to an individual author? What norms, related to the function of the author, will disclose the involvement of several authors? According to Saint Jerome, there are four criteria: the texts that must be eliminated from the list of works attributed to a single author are those inferior to the others (thus, the author is defined as a standard level of quality); those whose ideas conflict with the doctrine expressed in the others (here the author is defined as a certain field of conceptual or theoretical coherence); those written in a different style and containing words and phrases not ordinarily found in the other works (the author is seen as a stylistic uniformity); and those referring to events or historical figures subsequent to the death of the author (the author is thus a definite historical figure in which a series of events converge). Although modern criticism does not appear to have these same suspicions concerning authentication, its strategies for defining the author present striking similarities. The author explains the presence of certain events within a text, as well as their transformations, distortions, and their various modifications (and this through an author’s biography or by reference to his particular point of view, in the analysis of his social preferences and his position within a class or by delineating his fundamental objectives). The author also constitutes a principle of unity in writing where any unevenness of production is ascribed to changes caused by evolution, maturation, or outside influence. In addition, the author serves to neutralize the contradictions that are found in a series of texts. Governing this function is the belief that there must be — at a particular level of an author’s thought, of his conscious or unconscious desire — a point where contradictions are resolved, where the incompatible elements can be shown to relate to one another or to cohere around a fundamental and originating contradiction. Finally, the author is a particular source of expression who, in more or less finished forms, is manifested equally well, and with similar validity, in a text, in letters, fragments, drafts, and so forth.

To limit it is to isolate in the original texts a small set of propositions or statements that are recognized as having an inaugurative value and that mark other Freudian concepts or theories as derivative. Finally, there are no ‘false’ statements in the work of these initiators; those statements considered inessential or ‘prehistoric,’ in that they are associated with another discourse, are simply neglected in favor of the more pertinent aspects of the work. The initiation of a discursive practice, unlike the founding of a science, overshadows and is necessarily detached from its later developments and transformations. As a consequence, we define the theoretical validity of a statement with respect to the work of the initiator, whereas in the case of Galileo or Newton, it is based on the structural and intrinsic norms established in cosmology or physics. Stated schematically, the work of these initiators is not situated in relation to a science or in the space it defines; rather, it is science or discursive practice that relate to their works as the primary points of reference.",

And one of the things it challenges is modernism’s rigid opposition of artistic practice and theory.",

Nevertheless, there is a problematic tendency to constitute the pictorial text as the paradigmatic insistence of that inscription in a way which forecloses the question of its institutional placing. The pictorial paradigm constructs the artistic text as boThessentially singular and as centrally concerned with the practice of painting; but, as Hubert Damisch has pointed out, when painting is considered at the semiotic level, that is with reference to its internal system, it functions as an epistemological obstacle — an obstacle never surmounted, only prodded by an endless redefinition of the sign or averted altogether by taking the semantic route.1 Perhaps to some extent this accounts for what appears to be a certain impasse in the area of art criticism when compared, for instance, with developments in film theory.\n||route.1 - footnote||",

Nevertheless, there is a problematic tendency to constitute the pictorial text as the paradigmatic insistence of that inscription in a way which forecloses the question of its institutional placing. The pictorial paradigm constructs the artistic text as boThessentially singular and as centrally concerned with the practice of painting; but, as Hubert Damisch has pointed out, when painting is considered at the semiotic level, that is with reference to its internal system, it functions as an epistemological obstacle — an obstacle never surmounted, only prodded by an endless redefinition of the sign or averted altogether by taking the semantic route.1 Perhaps to some extent this accounts for what appears to be a certain impasse in the area of art criticism when compared, for instance, with developments in film theory.",

In opposition to theatrical or phenomenological models which take the gendered self to be prior to its acts, I will understand constituting acts not only as constituting the identity of the actor, but as constituting that identity as a compelling illusion, an object of __belief__. In the course of making my argument, I will draw from theatrical, anthropological, and philosophical discourses, but mainly phenomenology, to show that what is called gender identity is a performative accomplishment compelled by social sanction and taboo. In its very character as performative resides the possibility of contesting its reified status.",

Feminist theory has sought to understand the way in which systemic or pervasive political and cultural structures are enacted and reproduced through individual acts and practices, and how the analysis of ostensibly personal situations is clarified through situating the issues in a broader and shared cultural context. Indeed, the feminist impulse, and I am sure there is more than one, has often emerged in the recognition that my pain or my silence or my anger or my perception is fially not mine alone, and that it delimits me in a shared cultural situation which in turn enables and empowers me in certain unanticipated ways. The personal is thus implicitly political inasmuch as it is conditioned by shared social structures, but the personal has also been immunized against political challenge to the extent that public/private distinctions endure. For feminist theory, then, the personal becomes an expansive category, one which accommodates, if only implicitly, political structures usually viewed as public. Indeed, the very meaning of the political expands as well. At its best, feminist theory involves a dialectical expansion of both of these categories.

The contention that sex, gender, and heterosexuality are historical products which have become conjoined and reified as natural over time has received a good deal of critical attention not only from Michel Foucault, but Monique Wittig, gay historians, and various cultural anthropologists and social psychologists in recent years.8 These theories, however, still lack the critical resources for thinking radically about the historical sedimentation of sexuality and sex-related constructs if they do not delimit and describe the mundane manner in which these constructs are produced, reproduced, and maintained within the field of bodies.",

Leaving Boucher’s boudoir-encased fluff y pink nudes behind, by the early to mid-nineteenth century, French painters highlighted the delectable whiteness of their naked or almost naked women by posing them against dark bodies.45 As Lorraine O’Grady has so importantly asked in this regard, what about ‘Olympia’s Maid’? Once brought back into the frame, as it were, the maid points to the fact that it is not, strictly speaking, Olympia who is the greatest threat to the conventional gaze of aesthetic judgment, but the maid herself; surely the tendency to label Olympia a ‘gorilla’ is a displacement of racial anxieties generated by the maid. As O’Grady notes, the maid (painted after a professional model named Laura) is the ‘chaos that must be excised [from the picture], and it is her excision that stabilizes the West’s construct of the female body, for the “femininity” of the white female body is ensured by assigning the not-white to a chaos safely removed from sight. Thus, only the white body remains as the object of a voyeuristic, fetishizing male gaze.’46 While Olympia is clearly a challenge to the unbridled privilege of sexual ownership claimed by the upper-class European white male viewer, the chaos signified by the maid exceeds that proposed by Olympia to such a degree that the maid cannot even be mentioned in contemporaneous critical reviews without an immediate reference to her object status as Olympia’s possession (reinforced by Manet’s choice of the Astruc poem, which makes reference to a black slave, to accompany the picture in the catalogue).47 The maid, whose ‘hypersexuality possesses the white woman,’ threatens to ‘stain’ Olympia black, as Jennifer Brody has noted of the painting.48\n||bodies.45, gaze.’46, catalogue).47, painting.48 - footnote||",

One of the most influential works in this vein is Isaac Julien’s film __Looking for Langston__ (1998), which at once articulates the importance of the Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes as a black gay artist, mourns the erasure of homosexuality from representations of the Harlem Renaissance, and connects these subjects to the fragility of queer black queer bohemian communities today.",

By the 1860s, Thomas Cook, who had launched the modern tourist industry by organizing excursion trains (with the Midland Railway Company) to visit the first of the great exhibitions, at the Crystal Palace in 1851, was offering excursions to visit not exhibits of the East, but the ‘East itself.’ If Europe was becoming the world-as-exhibition, what happened to Europeans who went abroad — to visit places whose images invariably they had already encountered in books, spectacles, and exhibitions? How did they experience the so-called real world such images had depicted, when the reality was a place whose life was not lived, or at least not yet, as if the world were an exhibition?",

In fact, ‘experience,’ in this sense, depends upon the structure of the exhibition. The problem in a place such as Cairo, which had not been built to provide the experience of an exhibition, was to fulfill such a double desire. On his first day in Cairo, Gérard de Nerval met a French ‘painter’ equipped with a daguerreotype, who ‘suggested that I come with him to choose a point of view.’ Agreeing to accompany him, Nerval decided ‘to have myself taken to the most labyrinthine point of the city, abandon the painter to his tasks, and then wander off haphazardly, without interpreter or companion.’ But within the labyrinth of the city, where Nerval hoped to immerse himself in the exotic and finally experience ‘without interpreter’ the real Orient, they were unable to find any point from which to take the picture. They followed one crowded, twisting street after another, looking without success for a suitable viewpoint, until eventually the profusion of noises and people subsided and the streets became ‘more silent, more dusty, more deserted, the mosques fallen in decay and here and there a building in collapse.’ In the end they found themselves outside the city, ‘somewhere in the suburbs, on the other side of the canal from the main sections of the town.’ Here at last, amid the silence and the ruins, the photographer was able to set up his device and portray the Oriental city.50 […]"

In the United States, this new ideal was advocated most forcefully in the opening years of the century.

According to Gilman, works of art, once they are put in museums, exist for one purpose only: to be looked at as things of beauty. The first obligation of an art museum is to present works of art as just that, as objects of aesthetic contemplation and not as illustrative of historical or archaeological information. As he expounded it (sounding much like Hazlitt almost a century earlier), aesthetic contemplation is a profoundly transforming experience, an imaginative act of identification between viewer and artist. To achieve it, the viewer ‘must make himself over in the image of the artist, penetrate his intention, think with his thoughts, feel with his feelings.’26 The end result of this is an intense and joyous emotion, an overwhelming and ‘absolutely serious’ pleasure that contains a profound spiritual revelation. Gilman compares it to the ‘sacred conversations’ depicted in Italian Renaissance altarpieces — images in which saints who lived in different centuries miraculously gather in a single imaginary space and together contemplate the Madonna. With this metaphor, Gilman casts the modern aesthete as a devotee who achieves a kind of secular grace through communion with artistic geniuses of the past — spirits that offer a life-redeeming sustenance.‘Art is the Gracious Message pure and simple,’he wrote,‘integral to the perfect life,’ its contemplation ‘one of the ends of existence.’27",

Cult value as such tends today, it would seem, to keep the artwork out of sight: certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain images of the Madonna remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are not visible to the viewer at ground level. __With the emancipation of specific artistic practices from the service of ritual, the opportunities for exhibiting their products increase.__ It is easier to exhibit a portrait bust that can be sent here and there than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has a fixed place in the interior of a temple. A panel painting can be exhibited more easily than the mosaic or fresco which preceded it.

What begins as an empirically grounded caution is often elevated to a rigid theoretical doctrine.2 And nowhere is this move from methodological caution to inflexible theory as clearly evident as in the postmodernist suspicion of normativity, of values. This suspicion leads some thinkers — particularly progressive thinkers—into strange quandaries, or at least into obvious inconsistencies. Michel Foucault, for instance, in his 1971 debate with Noam Chomsky, initially raises the empirically based question about whether political activists and thinkers should rely on a substantive conception of human nature, deriving justification for their values and goals from such a conception. His initial point is a familiar one, and it is fundamentally sound: ‘If you say that a certain human nature exists, that this human nature has not been given in actual society the rights and the possibilities which allow it to realise itself ... [don’t you] risk defining this human nature — which is at the same time ideal and real ...—in terms borrowed from our society, from our civilization, from our culture?’ (‘Human Nature,’ 173–74). The ‘risk’ Foucault is talking about can be best understood in the context of the antipositivist theoretical insight I identified earlier. All knowledge is unavoidably socially situated, and it is impossible to seek the kind of objectivity that is understood as neutrality, as ideological or theoretical innocence. When we try to define human nature, we inevitably do so ‘in terms borrowed from our society, from our civilization, from our culture.’The legitimate question, then, is: since our account of human nature is inevitably shaped by our society and culture, the context in which the account originates, how can we minimize the risk of repeating our culture’s ideological errors, projecting our metaphysical blindnesses onto the ideal human nature we wish to imagine and theorize? Foucault’s initial point is also a more specifically historical one: we risk error in talking about human nature, he says, because we know of so many instances in the past when we have erred, and erred seriously and egregiously. Socialists of a certain period, he points out, unwittingly used a bourgeois model of human nature even when they claimed to be going beyond such a model and its ideological implications: ‘The socialism of ... the end of the nineteenth century, and the beginning of the twentieth century, admitted in effect that in capitalist societies man hadn’t realized the full potential of his development and self-realization. ... And [this socialism] dreamed of an ultimately liberated human nature. ... What model did it use to conceive, project, and eventually realize human nature? It was in fact the bourgeois model. The universalization of the model of the bourgeois has been the utopia which has animated the constitution of Soviet society.’All of this indicates, he concludes, ‘that it is difficult to say exactly what human nature is’ and that ‘there is a risk that we will be led into error’ (174).",

      "body": "The postmodernist view of error is often presented initially as an empirical caution, but the skepticism that it is supposed to lead to is deep and unwavering, ultimately amounting to an acontextual and unqualified position. What begins as an empirically grounded caution is often elevated to a rigid theoretical doctrine.2 And nowhere is this move from methodological caution to inflexible theory as clearly evident as in the postmodernist suspicion of normativity, of values. This suspicion leads some thinkers — particularly progressive thinkers—into strange quandaries, or at least into obvious inconsistencies. Michel Foucault, for instance, in his 1971 debate with Noam Chomsky, initially raises the empirically based question about whether political activists and thinkers should rely on a substantive conception of human nature, deriving justification for their values and goals from such a conception. His initial point is a familiar one, and it is fundamentally sound: ‘If you say that a certain human nature exists, that this human nature has not been given in actual society the rights and the possibilities which allow it to realise itself ... [don’t you] risk defining this human nature — which is at the same time ideal and real ...—in terms borrowed from our society, from our civilization, from our culture?’ (‘Human Nature,’ 173–74). The ‘risk’ Foucault is talking about can be best understood in the context of the antipositivist theoretical insight I identified earlier. All knowledge is unavoidably socially situated, and it is impossible to seek the kind of objectivity that is understood as neutrality, as ideological or theoretical innocence. When we try to define human nature, we inevitably do so ‘in terms borrowed from our society, from our civilization, from our culture.’The legitimate question, then, is: since our account of human nature is inevitably shaped by our society and culture, the context in which the account originates, how can we minimize the risk of repeating our culture’s ideological errors, projecting our metaphysical blindnesses onto the ideal human nature we wish to imagine and theorize?

But that is not Foucault’s main point. His point about the ‘risk’ (that ‘we will be led into error’) cuts deeper.

From empirically grounded cautions about error, we have been led to at least two possible theses: (1) there is no such thing as human nature; and/ or (2) our knowledge of human nature, even if there were such a thing, would never be reliable or objective, since everything we can say about human nature will be ideological. Now the two theses I have identified are distinct, and they call for different kinds of argument and evidence for support, but Foucault’s general attitude suggests that he is drawn to (at least) the skeptical thesis (2), which denies the possibility of objective knowledge altogether.

Foucault’s implausible epistemological holism is not in principle limited to values, since it can have relevance for all of human knowledge, but his arguments here focus on evaluative concepts since (as we saw above) they are simultaneously ‘ideal and real.’ His initial claim is that ‘justice,’ as an evaluative notion, is tied to various other features of our social world, those features that make our world what it in fact is. In arguing against the objectivity of evaluative notions like justice, Foucault is not drawing on the familiar observation that since, when we look cross-culturally, we see a variety of conceptions of justice, our own conception must be limited and culture-specific. For this familiar observation naturally elicits the objection that the presence of variety does not preclude the possibility that one of the existing conceptions is in fact better, more accurate than the others. Recognition of variety is useful, it might be argued, to show how some cultural contexts might in fact have enabled greater accuracy and objectivity in thinking about the nature of the just society, while others have served to distort our thinking about these matters. The mere existence of cultural variety in approaches to justice does nothing, it can be objected, to establish the general skeptical or relativist thesis, the thesis that notions of justice are entirely culture- or class-specific. But Foucault’s argument is not vulnerable to this objection, for at bottom he is proposing an epistemology of value. Values are always partly speculative, the claim goes, and we can never justify them since they are especially prone to social distortion. Indeed, this distortion is of a kind that undermines __any__ possibility of justification. You cannot expect to eliminate distortions produced by particular relations of power, say the class system, Foucault would say, because these relations are __inextricably__ dependent on various other things that make our society or culture what it is. It is this claim about __inextricability__ that makes Foucault’s position untenable, for it suggests that error and distortion cannot be eliminated and our critical analyses of social phenomena will always be radically compromised by the ideologies of our class or, more generally, our society. For Foucault, notions like justice are formed within overlapping structures of discourse and political power: they ‘have been formed within our civilization, within our type of knowledge, and our form of philosophy, and as a result form part of our class system.’ The type of knowledge and form of philosophy are causally related to the class system, but this relationship is so radically determined — or perhaps just so irreducibly complex — that it undermines any attempt to analyze the distortion produced by any one of them. That explains why (according to Foucault) even the search for slightly better, slightly less distorted, views of human nature or social and political justice is impossible.4 It is this crucial thesis about the analytical inextricability of power and truth, the reduction of all analysis to ideology, that makes Foucault’s epistemological holism extreme and implausible, and it on this kind of holism that the myth of an otherworldly, asocial (and always necessarily impossible) objectivity is based.",

His defense of the need for ‘better’ concepts of justice is based on the view that our most valuable notions of justice are firmly grounded in a plausible (though necessarily partial) view of human nature. ‘Our concept of human nature is certainly limited; it’s partially socially conditioned, constrained by our own character defects and the limitations of the intellectual culture in which we exist. Yet at the same time it is of critical importance that we know what impossible goals we’re trying to achieve, if we hope to achieve some of the possible ones. And that means that we have to be bold enough to speculate and create social theories on the basis of partial knowledge, while remaining very open to the strong possibility, and in fact overwhelming probability, that at least in some respects we’re very far off the mark’ (175). Here is a view of how partly speculative notions like human nature are not only necessary but also legitimate; it outlines an epistemological approach I take for granted in the second section of this paper, where I propose an alternative to the Foucauldian (and, more generally, the postmodernist) account of values. Foucault is deeply suspicious of all evaluative concepts because, as he claims, power and knowledge are so deeply intertwined that we cannot ‘extrapolate’ from our current ideologically tainted concepts to less ideological, more ‘objective ’ones.This claim about the relationship of power and knowledge, as I have shown, is based on an extreme form of epistemological holism, which is an implausible version of the legitimate postpositivist thesis about the theory-dependence of all knowledge. It is this kind of implausible holism which sanctions Foucault’s own view of objectivity as a kind of (absolute) epistemic neutrality, a view that mirrors the widely criticized positivist conception of objectivity. The net effect of these theses is that Foucault’s skepticism about values (and perhaps all knowledge) becomes an a priori matter; notwithstanding the numerous statements about current ideologies and political arrangements, the skepticism itself is entirely independent of any empirical understanding of actually existing societies. Even though Foucault claims that he cannot find historical justification for the hope that we will be able to come up with better values and visions than what exist, his own skepticism about values is itself free of empirical support or justification.And there does not seem to be much room left open for seeking such support for it. Once we adopt this extreme thesis about values, that better values, genuinely better ones, must make no reference at all to the fundaments of our society, culture, and civilization, the skeptical position follows automatically. And the skepticism is insulated from any real empirical testing and elaboration. For there can be no genuine empirical elaboration of a claim without the possibility that the claim might itself be proved wrong. When we acknowledge such a possibility, this overly inflexible skeptical stance, this suspicion of normative theory as such, becomes untenable. In the realm of social analysis, such a priori skepticism becomes dogmatic or doctrinaire, since it leaves open no room for its own empirical or theoretical errors. Oddly enough (or, some would say, naturally enough), such a doctrinaire approach bases itself on claims about the ubiquity of ideological error and the need for a rigorous analysis of socially based distortions.",

Such evaluative notions will naturally reflect the underlying biases and ideologies, the theoretical prejudices and empirical limitations, of our own cultural views. But they also reflect — either badly or well, reflecting degrees of error and distortion but also accuracy and objectivity — what we currently know about humankind and its possibilities. When I talk about ‘reference’ here, I mean a process and a relation that are dynamic rather than static: our deeper evaluative notions are linked not to unique and singular objects in the world but instead to complex objects and the way we gain epistemic access to them. On this view of reference, then, as a culture acquires more accurate knowledge of, say, human potentials and capacities, its central evaluative notions and concepts will become richer. Such knowledge depends on a number of factors, from everyday practical experiments with, say, child-rearing or forms of education to more self-consciously reflexive and methodologically systematic kinds of research conducted within institutions.There is room here for both objective knowledge and error, since our deepest evaluations — regarding such things as social justice, for instance — refer not only to what we, in a given culture, know __now,__ but also, necessarily, to what we may come to know later about the object of inquiry. Our values are thus ‘open-textured’ in nature, open in the same way that any knowledge-gathering process is.

In contrast to the more recently established science of artificial life discussed later in this chapter, AI was based on a paradigm of centralized control.The computer was conceived as analogous to the brain in the sense that it governed all functions of the system to be studied. Communications theory, cybernetics, general systems theory, and AI all had in common the study of processes of organization, development, and interaction, concerns shared by various contemporary scientists and philosophers.14",

This instrumental facet of the term is largely submerged in modern discourse in favour of the ‘objecthood’ of art.16 What would an art historical or museological practice consist of which was attentive to this ambivalence?",

Being is not distinct (except nominally or verbally) from interpretation, which is to say not distinct from artifice.The point is that religion is a mode of artistry which is in denial of (or is duplicitous regarding) the fabricatedness of its own inventions, commonly attributing that artifice to the ‘design’ of an immaterial, and (for sectarian believers) a pre-existent and originating, force or being.",
