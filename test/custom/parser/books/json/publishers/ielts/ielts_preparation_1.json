Sometimes it might be just the fact that it is called an exam, that makes students get together and study harder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some students might feel discouraged by the same fact that makes the others motivated what of course results in low marks in the actual exam. They also think that the results are very often not relevant to their efforts they put into studying.

They often think that there could be another way of testing, less stressful, that should be introduced in schools or universities.
