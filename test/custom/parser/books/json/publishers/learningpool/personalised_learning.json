They’re now having an impact on general education and corporate learning, especially in the area of onboarding, where they serve as the first port of call for new hire training and allow new employees to learn as they work.\r\n\r\nThe Q&A format of interaction with a bot allows that training to reflect an employee’s personal learning needs. It saves the organisation from the overhead and time-sink of running courses that not everyone needs and prevent training becoming a one-off event that results only in information overload.\r\n\r\nLearnbots can also operate within, or as a front end to, learning management systems (LMS) or learning experience platforms (LXP).
