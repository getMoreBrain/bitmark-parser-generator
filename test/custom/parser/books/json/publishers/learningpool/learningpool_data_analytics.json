So as you move to do that planning, here are some things to keep in mind along the way.\r\n\r\n1. **Take a 360 approach to learning data** — You wouldn’t drive using only your rearview mirror, so don’t restrict your focus to learning evaluation (as important as it is); a more holistic approach will also give you side mirrors, dash-cam, and a clearer view of the road ahead. It’s not all about evaluation or analytics.\r\n\r\n2. **Be proactive** — If you wait to be asked for better data by the business, the conspiracy of convenience theory suggests it might never happen, but you will run the risk of irrelevance and, ultimately, obsolescence. Start today in making data a central part of your practice and educate your internal and external customers on the benefits of taking a data-led approach.\r\n\r\n3. **Make a realistic assessment of your and your organization’s maturity** using learning data as the first step in making improvements. The Learning Analytics Maturity Model (LAMM) will help you do this.\r\n\r\n4. **Start from where you are** using the resources you have to hand. Today’s organizations are awash with data, although it might mean forging new alliances and learning new skills to get hold of it.\r\n\r\n5. **Take an agile approach** — Start small, fail fast, learn by doing. Use the Learning Analytics Canvas as a starting point for your next project and see how the project could be driven differently when you start with data.\r\n\r\n6. **Use multiple data sources to evaluate** and take a portfolio-of-evidence approach — and don’t expect there to be a smoking gun when it comes to evaluating impact. Chances are you will only be able to prove that you might be the reason something changed; but you can stack that deck higher with more data points.\r\n\r\n7. **The customer is always right** — In order to progress the adoption of learning analytics in your business, you’ll need to convince customers that the output of your work is worth it. Once customers start asking for analytics, data from the LAMM shows, the business seems to fall in line.",
