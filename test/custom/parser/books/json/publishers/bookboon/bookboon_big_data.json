Results of the survey highlight that organisations are more likely to achieve success in their data security and privacy initiatives, than those of data quality, standardisation and data life-cycle management. Achieving data quality and information governance remains a challenging area for many organisations, these factors, however, are paramount for successful BI implementations.",
