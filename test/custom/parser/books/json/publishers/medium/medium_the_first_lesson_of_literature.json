The first time the children are abandoned, well, it’s to be expected in their family. Though their stepmother seems to make their lives an experiment in finding new ways to be cruel, their father’s passivity frustrates her most homicidal inclinations. Because Hansel doesn’t deny the low-level threat humming under each day in his home, he is the model of planning for contingencies, of innovating around disaster. Sometimes, the text suggests, a good idea is like stones on the ground that will return you to safety should things go horribly awry.",
