From the vain mask of the corpse, the same smile persists. But when the madman laughs, he already laughs with the laugh of death; the lunatic, anticipating the macabre, has disarmed it. […] The substitution of the theme of madness for that of death does not mark a break, but rather a torsion within the same anxiety. What is at question is still the nothingness of existence, but this nothingness is no longer considered an external, final form, both threat and conclusion; it is experienced from within as the continuous and constant form of existence.__"
