According to the United Midwest Security Alliance, the following industries provide both opportunities for cyberattacks in addition to financial incentives:\n\n• **Financial institutions**\n• Financial institutions and banks are particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches because hackers can gain access to credit card information, bank account information, etc., and this can result in money takeovers.\n\n• **Hospitals**\n• In general, hospitals are some of the most vulnerable intuitions because of general lack of necessary funding. Additionally, medical facilities can be seen by attackers as cyber goldmines with a hodgepodge of outdated systems and understaffed employees with little cyber training. Additionally, if attacked, hospitals generally have more of an incentive to quickly pay cybercriminals so they can get back to the data held hostage by ransomware. Especially, when dealing with people’s lives and their medical data.\n\n• **Schools and universities**\n• What makes academic institutions vulnerable is their lack of general cybersecurity measures. One study by Tifoil Security tested the networks of 557 state universities with a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The results found that a whopping 25% of universities were vulnerable. Also, schools tend to keep most of their information publicly available, specifically about the people they employ, with online access to email addresses and this makes schools prime targets for phishing schemes.\n\n• **Retailers**\n• Retailers collecting and protecting data through a variety of sources, from point of sale machines to tap to pay terminals, can prove to be quite challenging. The massive amount of data to protect across multiple endpoints is no easy task. Additionally, card data collected at the time of purchase is often fed into vulnerable analytic systems used by marketers to track customer buying habits.”\n\n==“Mission & Vision.”==|link:https://umsa-security.org/mission-vision/| United Midwest Security Alliance, Mar. 2017",

These are often used in preparation for another type of attack.\n• **Inject unexpected items**: Attack patterns within this category focus on the ability to control or disrupt the behavior of a target, either through crafted data submitted via an interface for data input or the installation and execution of malicious code on the target system.\n• **Engage in deceptive interactions**: Attack patterns within this category focus on malicious interactions with a target in an attempt to deceive and convince the target that it is interacting with some other principal — and then to drive actions based on the level of trust that exists between the target and the other principal.\n• **Manipulate timing and state**: An attacker exploits weakness in timing or state, maintaining functions to perform actions that would otherwise be prevented by the execution flow of the target code and processes.\n• **Abuse existing functionality**: An adversary uses or manipulates one or more functions of an application in order to achieve a malicious objective — one not originally intended by the application — or to deplete a resource to the point that the target’s functionality is affected.\n• **Employ probabilistic techniques**: An attacker utilizes probabilistic techniques to explore and overcome security properties of the target that are based on an assumption of strength due to the extremely low mathematical probability that an attacker would be able to identify and exploit the very rare specific conditions under which those security properties do not hold.\n• **Subvert access control**: An attacker actively targets exploitation of weaknesses, limitations, and assumptions in the mechanisms a target utilizes to manage identity and authentication, as well as manage access to its resources or authorize functionality.\n• **Manipulate data structures**: Attack patterns in this category manipulate and exploit characteristics of system data structures in order to violate the intended usage and protections of these structures.\n• **Manipulate system resources**: Attack patterns within this category focus on the adversary’s ability to manipulate one or more resources in order to achieve a desired outcome.\n\n==“CAPEC CATEGORY: Collect and Analyze Information.”==|link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/118.html| CAPEC Content Team, Jan. 2017",
