The basis of this is a command-line tool called git, which is used for version control on your local computer. You attach git to a folder on your local computer. When you make some significant changes, you can commit the changes to the version history and add a short comment about the changes that you made. You can then connect the local version history to Github. That can help if you are collaborating with other people. It’s also extremely useful if you work across different computers, e.g. on your laptop and a university server, or when you want to have a backup of your work. The version history is particularly useful if you want to recover an earlier version. For instance, if you are writing some code and realise that you made a mistake at some point that completely breaks it, you can recover an earlier version quite easily to establish where you might have gone wrong.",

The basis of this is a command-line tool called git, which is used for version control on your local computer. You attach git to a folder on your local computer. When you make some significant changes, you can commit the changes to the version history and add a short comment about the changes that you made. You can then connect the local version history to Github. That can help if you are collaborating with other people. It’s also extremely useful if you work across different computers, e.g. on your laptop and a university server, or when you want to have a backup of your work. The version history is particularly useful if you want to recover an earlier version. For instance, if you are writing some code and realise that you made a mistake at some point that completely breaks it, you can recover an earlier version quite easily to establish where you might have gone wrong.",

These active elements and the feedback are an enormous help for learning and engagement. Third, Coursera offers certificates at very reasonable prices (typically around £30 for a 4-week course).
