The Romans regarded the __Aeneid__ as their great national epic, and it had enormous influence over later writers and thinkers. As well as being powerful literature, the __Aeneid__ tells us a great deal about how the Romans saw themselves and their culture, and what it meant to be a Roman.\n\nI’ll begin by introducing the genre of epic poetry in which the __Aeneid__ was written, and by looking at what happens in the poem, and how it relates to the events of Virgil’s own day. (Virgil lived between 70 and 19 BCE, and wrote the __Aeneid__ at the end of his life.) We’ll then go on to look in detail at some sections of the poem, looking in particular at how it presents Roman values. The discussion will introduce you to a small number of key Latin words used to express these values, though it doesn’t expect or require any knowledge of the Latin language.\n\nThis OpenLearn course is an adapted extract from the Open University course **A276 Classical Latin: the language of ancient Rome**.",

Although early Italians may well have had their own native traditions of heroic song, no traces of these survive, and the earliest attempt to write epic poetry in Latin was a translation of the __Odyssey__ into the Latin language by Livius Andronicus in the mid third century bce. Although only fragments of this survive, the fact that Livius chose to translate a Greek epic poem shows the strong association between the genre and Greek culture. However, it wasn’t long before Roman poets began to tell the stories of their own society. The first to do so was Naevius, who wrote a poem on the Punic War with Carthage (also in the third century bce), followed by the second-century-bce poet Ennius, whose __Annals__ told the history of Rome to his own day, though as with Livius, only fragments of these are preserved.

The __Aeneid__ tells the story of how Aeneas escaped the fall of Troy and led a band of survivors to Italy, where their destiny was to mix with the native population and create a new chosen race.

Setting the __Aeneid__ in the aftermath of the Trojan War helps Virgil to show that he is trying to rival the epic poems of Homer, usually considered the greatest poet of all. The __Aeneid__ is made up of twelve books of about 700 lines each: the first six deal with the travels of Aeneas after the fall of Troy, and the second six with the war he is forced to fight in Italy. This means that the first half of the poem is designed to remind the reader of Homer’s __Odyssey__, which narrates the wanderings of Odysseus, and the second half reflects the Iliad, which is set during the Trojan War. By combining the travel theme and the military theme in a single poem (with only 12 books, rather than the 24 in each of the __Iliad__ and __Odyssey__) Virgil could imply that he was outdoing Homer, and that his poem contained all the themes of a heroic epic.",

Virgil had lived through a generation of violence, as successive warlords had torn the Roman Republic apart in their struggles for power. This culminated in the rise of the young Octavian, the adopted son of Julius Caesar, who defeated his rivals Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium (31 bce) and established himself as ruler of Rome, with the new name Augustus. Virgil was working on the __Aeneid__ throughout the 20s bce, by which time Augustus had imposed stability, but the traumas of the past were still a recent memory. Several passages in the __Aeneid__ use prophecy or supernatural knowledge to refer directly to historical events of Virgil’s own day. These passages identify and praise Augustus himself, and Virgil hopes for a new era of peace under his rule. However, the Roman future is not limited to these passages; rather, Virgil uses his mythological setting and characters to reflect upon what it means to be a Roman, and draws links between the past and the present. Thus the struggles that Aeneas and his companions face in Italy are relevant to the broad questions of how a good Roman should live, the values he should hold, and how he should deal with difficult situations.\n\nIn this course I’ll be guiding you through some of the crucial passages in the __Aeneid__ that deal with these ideas, and I’ll be encouraging you to reflect on how Virgil handles them.

Here they encounter Queen Dido, leader of the Carthaginians, who are recent immigrants from Phoenicia (modern Lebanon and Syria), and are founding a new city, Carthage (Book 1). (The map in Figure 2 shows the key places mentioned in the poem.) Aeneas tells Dido of the destruction of Troy (Book 2), and his subsequent travels around the Mediterranean (Book 3). He and Dido soon fall in love, but Aeneas is in danger of forgetting his mission in Italy, so the king of the gods, Jupiter, sends his messenger Mercury to remind him of his duty. Aeneas’ sudden departure leaves Dido devastated, and she commits suicide and pronounces eternal hatred between the future Romans and the Carthaginians (Book 4). After a stop in Sicily (Book 5), Aeneas travels to the underworld to speak to the ghost of his father, and he sees there the souls of the future great Romans (Book 6). He is then finally able to arrive in Italy, where he is initially welcomed by the local king Latinus, who promises him his daughter Lavinia’s hand in marriage to seal peace between Trojans and Latins. However, other Italians resent this arrangement, including Latinus’ wife Amata and the Italian prince Turnus, who hoped to marry Lavinia himself. War soon breaks out between the Trojans and the Italians, to Aeneas’ dismay (Book 7). Aeneas visits another local king, Evander, whose city is built on the site of the future Rome, and Evander agrees to ally his people with the Trojans and sends his son Pallas with Aeneas for his first experience of war. Pallas is presented as a sympathetic character: a brave young man whose life is just beginning, and Aeneas feels a strong affection for him (Book 8). The war in Italy continues to rage (Book 9) and Pallas is killed by Turnus, causing a furious response in Aeneas (Book 10). Aeneas agrees to a temporary truce, and suggests he and Turnus should meet in a duel, to avoid any more loss of life, but while the Italians are debating this, war breaks out again (Book 11). Turnus finally agrees to meet Aeneas in single combat, but Juno arranges for the truce to be broken. However, when Jupiter persuades Juno to give up her hatred of the Trojans and accept the Roman destiny, she removes her protection from Turnus. He and Aeneas meet again on the battlefield, and Aeneas wounds Turnus, who begs for mercy. Aeneas is on the point of sparing him when he sees that Turnus is wearing the belt of Pallas, and kills him in a fit of rage (Book 12).",

Virgil here switches the usual set of conventions: rather than using imagery from the natural world to describe human passions (e.g. anger is like a storm), he uses imagery from political life to describe a natural phenomenon (a storm is like political discord). This is the passage that first sets up the idea that __pietas__ can overcome __furor__, and so it’s significant that Virgil chooses the sphere of politics and civil discord as a frame. This will be relevant throughout the __Aeneid__, as we see Aeneas trying to be a good leader, and it becomes especially relevant in the second half of the poem, in which we see __furor__ causing hatred and war in Italy. It’s also relevant to Virgil’s contemporary readers, who may think of the conflicts they have lived through.

His __pietas__ is also shown by his concern for the well-being of his followers. His first act when he lands safely in north Africa after surviving the storm in Book 1 is to find high ground to see if he can spot any survivors from the other ships in his fleet; next he goes hunting, making sure that he shoots enough meat for all those with him. He is aware that his followers are in low spirits, and makes efforts to comfort them and to conceal his own anxieties. Thus in many ways Aeneas appears to be the ideal Roman leader: able to take charge yet concerned with the greater good of the group rather than his own personal self-interest. If you have time, you might like to explore this section of the __Aeneid__ further and think about how Aeneas is presented. You can find Book 1 of the Aeneid via the ‘**Poetry in Translation**’ website. To read the section we’ve been discussing here, you will need to click on the link ‘Bk1:157–222 Shelter on the Libyan coast’.\n\nYet despite Aeneas’ inherent __pietas__, he often falls prey to his own strong emotions and succumbs to __furor__. During the sack of Troy, despite repeated messages from the gods, he is frequently overcome by battle-lust and desire to take vengeance on the Greeks, and it is not until his goddess mother intervenes that he accepts his destiny to save the survivors of his people and find a new home. Similarly, in north Africa he falls passionately in love with the Carthiginian Queen Dido, and it is the ‘madness’ of love that makes Aeneas temporarily forget his journey and stay in Carthage. Aeneas and Dido’s love affair is described in terms that evoke __furor__, with imagery of fire and storms. But the greatest clash in the poem between __furor__ and __pietas__ comes at the very end, and we will explore this in the next section.",

To read the section we’ve been discussing here, you will need to click on the link ‘Bk1:157–222 Shelter on the Libyan coast’.\n\nYet despite Aeneas’ inherent __pietas__, he often falls prey to his own strong emotions and succumbs to __furor__. During the sack of Troy, despite repeated messages from the gods, he is frequently overcome by battle-lust and desire to take vengeance on the Greeks, and it is not until his goddess mother intervenes that he accepts his destiny to save the survivors of his people and find a new home. Similarly, in north Africa he falls passionately in love with the Carthiginian Queen Dido, and it is the ‘madness’ of love that makes Aeneas temporarily forget his journey and stay in Carthage. Aeneas and Dido’s love affair is described in terms that evoke __furor__, with imagery of fire and storms. But the greatest clash in the poem between __furor__ and __pietas__ comes at the very end, and we will explore this in the next section.",

    "bitmark": "[.article:bitmark--]\n[@id:136261]\nVirgil makes it clear that the rational side of Aeneas is on the brink of sparing Turnus, and it is only the sight of Pallas’ belt that changes his mind. Let’s look at the lines that describe Aeneas’ reaction here:\n\nAs soon as his eyes took in the trophy, a memory of cruel grief,\nAeneas, blazing with fury [__furor__], and terrible in his anger, cried:\n‘Shall you be snatched from my grasp, wearing the spoils\nof one who was my own?’\n(__Aeneid__ 12.946–9)\n\nAeneas acts in impulsive anger, and he acts from __furor__ rather than a considered sense of what is right: indeed, he is ‘blazing’ with it. As we have seen, __furor__ is often associated with fire imagery. Even if Aeneas makes a valid decision in killing Turnus, he seems to be doing it for the wrong reasons, and it’s troubling that the foundational act that will found the Roman race is one of __furor__ and anger.\n\nVirgil has already referred to the issue of vengeance and mercy earlier in the poem, in a scene in which Aeneas is visiting the underworld in Book 6 to consult the ghost of his father, Anchises. Virgil’s underworld contains the souls of those not yet born as well as those of the dead, and Aeneas is allowed to see a parade of future heroes of Rome, including Romulus, Julius Caesar, and Augustus himself. Anchises makes a speech to Aeneas predicting the glory of Rome and introduces the individuals who will make it great; at the end, he turns to the more general question of what it means to be a good Roman, and addresses the hypothetical future Roman:\n\n‘Remember, Roman, it is for you to rule the nations with your power,\n(that will be your skill) to crown peace with law,\nto spare the conquered, and subdue the proud’.\n(__Aeneid__ 6.851–3)\n\nAnchises claims that war is an essential part of the Roman mission, and that peace will come through military conflict. His final words refer to how a good Roman should balance mercy and retribution. In Anchises’ model it is easy to tell where to draw the line: only those who show arrogance should be crushed, while those who have been crushed should be spared. In reality, however, it is harder to tell the difference, and we might well recall his words as we read the final scene, and wonder which category Turnus fits into. His previous actions in the poem have been arrogant, but he is certainly now defeated: does that mean that Aeneas has failed to live up to his father’s advice when he refuses to pardon him?\n\nThe fact that the poem ends so abruptly makes this scene even starker. We might expect Virgil to end his poem by describing the end of the war, the reconciliation between the two peoples, perhaps even Aeneas’ marriage to Lavinia or the foundation of Lavinium. Instead, we’re left on a bleak note, as our final image is of the dying Turnus, unmitigated by any of the positive consequences of his death in the future.\n\nScholars have debated for many years how best to interpret the poem’s ending. We know that Virgil was unhappy with the __Aeneid__ as it stood, and requested on his deathbed that it should be burned, and scholars have sometimes suggested that this is because he wanted to alter the ending. On the other hand, there’s no particular reason to suppose that the ending was the part that Virgil felt was incomplete, and there may have been other aspects that he wanted to change. Indeed, there are other ways in which the __Aeneid__ is obviously unfinished, for example missing parts of lines. In any case, since we have the ending that we have, we need to engage with the poem as it stands, and try to interpret how it works in literary terms.\n\nFor some scholars, Aeneas’ killing of Turnus is an act which undermines the Roman future, and calls Augustus’ own achievements into question. For others, Aeneas’ actions show that the world is a complicated place in which idealistic models do not work: killing Turnus may be disagreeable, but it is part of the necessary price for establishing peace.",
