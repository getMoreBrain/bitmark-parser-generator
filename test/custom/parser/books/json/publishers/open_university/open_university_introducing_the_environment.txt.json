This link is most apparent in the shape of two tides every day, which change the sea water in the pool and bring in new organisms from the open ocean (as well as allowing others to escape back into the sea). The tides also change the physical characteristics of the pool and its surroundings. When the tide is out, the rockpool is a collection of organisms living together in a fairly clearly defined place. When the tide is in, the pool may become no more than a small depression on the rocky sea bed.\n\nNow let's look at the components of our rockpool ecosystem in more detail. Remember, any ecosystem contains living things, a physical environment and a source of energy.\n\nThe most obvious living things will tend to be the largest ones: seaweeds, sea anemones, whelks, shrimps, fish and so on. But this shouldn't blind us to the importance of the organisms we can't see. For example, the water itself is full of tiny plants and animals – called ‘plankton’ – that are food for many of the larger creatures. And the water and rocks contain huge numbers of the simple single-celled organisms called bacteria, and other microscopic forms of life, that play an important part in the working of the ecosystem.\n\nThe most obvious components of the physical environment of the pool are the rock that surrounds it, the sea water in it, and the air above it (when the tide is out). But these physical factors are far from fixed. The tides, and the effect of sunlight on the exposed pool, mean that the organisms that live in it must be able to withstand changes and extremes of, for example, temperature or salt content. Some small pools dry up altogether in the summer or ice over in winter when the tide is out.\n\nAlmost all of the energy that supports the life in the pool arrives in the form of light from the sun. Some of this energy is captured by seaweeds attached to the rocks and microscopic plants (types of plankton). These plants are eaten by animals, which are eaten by other animals, and so on. But the sun is not the only source of energy involved in the workings of this particular ecosystem: the tides that sweep across the pool twice a day are driven up and down the beach by the gravitational pull of the moon.",

These correspond to different forms of energy – kinetic (motion), thermal (heat), light, and chemical (food or fuel).\n\nEnergy can be converted from one form to another. For example, a plant converts sunlight into chemical energy. The energy from the food we eat (chemical energy) is used to keep us warm (heat energy), to enable us to move (kinetic energy) and to enable us to grow or put on weight (chemical energy in muscle and fat).\n\nAlthough energy can go through many conversions, there is one rule that appears to apply everywhere in the universe.

These correspond to different forms of energy – kinetic (motion), thermal (heat), light, and chemical (food or fuel).\n\nEnergy can be converted from one form to another. For example, a plant converts sunlight into chemical energy. The energy from the food we eat (chemical energy) is used to keep us warm (heat energy), to enable us to move (kinetic energy) and to enable us to grow or put on weight (chemical energy in muscle and fat).\n\nAlthough energy can go through many conversions, there is one rule that appears to apply everywhere in the universe. That is, energy cannot be created or destroyed – in any process, the total amount of energy is always constant.",

Try to pick out one or two of the main ideas in each paragraph.]\n[&article:\nLet's examine the concept of an ecosystem in more detail using an example that is familiar to many people: a rockpool on a British beach (see Figure 1).\n\nLike all ecosystems, a rockpool is linked to the wider world and to other ecosystems. This link is most apparent in the shape of two tides every day, which change the sea water in the pool and bring in new organisms from the open ocean (as well as allowing others to escape back into the sea). The tides also change the physical characteristics of the pool and its surroundings. When the tide is out, the rockpool is a collection of organisms living together in a fairly clearly defined place. When the tide is in, the pool may become no more than a small depression on the rocky sea bed.\n\nNow let's look at the components of our rockpool ecosystem in more detail. Remember, any ecosystem contains living things, a physical environment and a source of energy.\n\nThe most obvious living things will tend to be the largest ones: seaweeds, sea anemones, whelks, shrimps, fish and so on. But this shouldn't blind us to the importance of the organisms we can't see. For example, the water itself is full of tiny plants and animals – called ‘plankton’ – that are food for many of the larger creatures. And the water and rocks contain huge numbers of the simple single-celled organisms called bacteria, and other microscopic forms of life, that play an important part in the working of the ecosystem.\n\nThe most obvious components of the physical environment of the pool are the rock that surrounds it, the sea water in it, and the air above it (when the tide is out). But these physical factors are far from fixed. The tides, and the effect of sunlight on the exposed pool, mean that the organisms that live in it must be able to withstand changes and extremes of, for example, temperature or salt content. Some small pools dry up altogether in the summer or ice over in winter when the tide is out.\n\nAlmost all of the energy that supports the life in the pool arrives in the form of light from the sun. Some of this energy is captured by seaweeds attached to the rocks and microscopic plants (types of plankton). These plants are eaten by animals, which are eaten by other animals, and so on. But the sun is not the only source of energy involved in the workings of this particular ecosystem: the tides that sweep across the pool twice a day are driven up and down the beach by the gravitational pull of the moon.\n]\n|note:Discussion\nHere's my attempt.\n\nRockpool ecosystem – links to other ecosystems and wider world.\n\nEcosystem – living organisms, physical environment, energy.\n\nLiving things – plants, animals, plankton, bacteria.\n\nPhysical environment – rock, sea water, air, tides.\n\nEnergy – sunlight (also tides caused by pull of the moon).\n\nDid you note many of the same points?

Notes can be used for a number of things:\n\n• to develop your own understanding of what you are reading\n• to prepare for a specific task, say, a written assignment\n• to act as a record for revision.\n\nThe first purpose is probably the most important one. After all, it is much easier to write about or revise something that you already understand. Making notes forces you to think about what you are reading and to make sense of it. You have to engage with the text, identify the main points and record them in some way. Good notes pay off in two ways. First, the very process of making and organising your notes improves your understanding of what you have read. Second, your notes will serve as a reminder of the main points long after you have moved on.\n\nThe first step is to read the material. Don't worry too much about making notes on the first read through. The important thing is to concentrate on following the line of the argument and making sure that you understand the key points.\n\nThen review the material. Locate the main ideas as well as important points that relate to them. If the book is yours, you can underline or highlight important words or definitions, put a box around important passages, or write notes in the margin.\n\nAlternatively, you can make notes on a separate piece of paper. Remember to leave lots of space so that you can add extra thoughts later on. Learning is a process of changing and developing your understanding. Your notes may take the form of paragraphs, short phrases, bullet points or diagrams (for example, spray diagrams).\n\nThe form your notes take will depend on a number of factors:\n\n• the techniques that work best for you\n• the nature of what you are reading\n• the purpose of your notes\n• how much time you have.\n\nRemember that the notes you produce are your notes. Experiment to find out what works best for you.\n\nOver time, you will probably develop a range of approaches. So, for example, I tend to use sentences or short paragraphs for material that I find fairly straightforward (see Activity 4). For texts that are more complicated or more difficult to follow I might use a spray diagram. Visual representations often take longer to prepare, but I find the extra investment of time and thought can really help to deepen my understanding. Again, this is a personal preference. Some people find it easier to work with, and to understand, diagrams and pictures. Other people prefer words and lists.\n\nAt some point you'll have to give some thought to housekeeping. Where will you keep your notes? In a notebook or a ring binder? I prefer looseleaf notes in a ring binder, as I can add extra pages as necessary, but the choice is up to you. The main thing is to make sure that you can find your notes again when you need them.\n\nFinally, a health warning! Don't put too much time and effort into making notes – and try to avoid writing out the entire text in note form. The trick is to develop an approach that provides the most benefit for the least effort. Always remember that making notes should be a pleasure not a chore. Making notes is an essential part of studying, and if you enjoy the process you'll find you learn a lot more.",

The naming of living things has always had an important practical function, allowing us to understand the natural environment and exploit it more effectively. As soon as something has a name, all sorts of useful information can be attached to the label. Is this plant good to eat or poisonous? Is this animal rare or plentiful? The information can then be passed from one member of a group to another, and from one generation to the next.\n\nScientists face a similar need. To understand an ecosystem we need to be able to name and list the organisms involved in a precise and accurate way. Naming – like reductionism – is a strategy that allows us to impose some order on the complexity of the natural world.\n\nThe science writer Richard Fortey explains the importance of this in his book Life: __An Unauthorised Biography__\n\n__Discrimination and identification have value beyond the obvious separation of edible from poisonous, valuable from worthless, or safe from dangerous. This is a means to gain an appreciation of the richness of the environment and our human place within it. The variety of the world is the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution, of catastrophes survived, and of ecological expansion. To begin to grasp any of this complexity the first task is to identify and recognise its component parts: for biologists, this means the species of animals and plants, both living and extinct.__\n(Fortey, 1998, p. 14)\n\nAs Richard Fortey notes, the **species** is the fundamental unit of biological diversity. But what is a ‘species’? And how do we distinguish one species from another?\n\nIn the field, scientists use two approaches to identify a species. Neither is without its problems.\n\n• Members of the same species normally resemble each other.\n• Male and female members of the same species can breed with each other to produce offspring that are also able to reproduce.\n\nThe first approach, appearance, is the most obvious one for most of us most of the time. We know that a robin is a robin because it looks like a robin – and the word ‘species’ is derived from the Latin verb specere (‘to look at’). But appearances can be deceptive. Males and females of a given species may look different, and many organisms change their appearance as they mature (say, from tadpole to frog or from caterpillar to butterfly).\n\nThe second approach is also fairly straightforward in most cases. We take it for granted that our robin can breed with other robins to produce more robins, and that these robins will, in their turn, breed with other robins. But in some circumstances, members of closely related species can and do breed with each other. For example, the horse and the donkey can breed with each other, although the offspring – a mule – is unable to reproduce.\n\nThe concept of the species is important to biologists and to our understanding of the working of ecosystems and the biosphere. That's why I've spent some time on it here. The number of species in an ecosystem, or the biosphere as a whole, is an important indicator of its health. Perhaps it is best to think of species as more or less permanent varieties of living things. Many biologists feel that although the definition of a species has its difficulties, in most cases they know one when they see one. The exceptions to the rules are a useful reminder that the complexity of the natural world does not always conform to the categories we attempt to impose on it, and that as a consequence the use of scientific terminology requires judgement and common sense.",

You will come across these scientific names from time to time, so it is useful to know how they work.\n\nDogs and wolves share a lot of features in common, so they are put together in a **genus** – a grouping of related species – called Canis. They don't normally interbreed, so they are different species: for example, __Canis familiaris__ (the domestic dog) and Canis lupus(the grey wolf). The Latin names of species are given in italics, or underlined if handwritten. The name of the genus starts with an upper-case letter; the name that indicates the species is given a lower-case letter. All human beings are members of the same species: __Homo sapiens__.\n\nAs far as I know, only one animal has a common name that is the same as its scientific name: the boa constrictor (__Boa constrictor__).",

I have included it here because Darwin sets out beautifully, in one sentence, the complexity of the natural world.\n\nFirst, he introduces us to an ecosystem – ‘an entangled bank’. (I like to think of this as a hedgerow in my home county of Wiltshire. In my mind's eye, I see it on a warm summer's day: a jumbled mix of plants – flowers and trees – with insects crawling through the undergrowth and birds feeding in the branches.)\n\nDarwin notes that this ecosystem consists of different populations of organisms that live together in a particular location or habitat – plants, worms, insects and birds. He also suggests that these organisms are dependent on each other in a number of complicated ways, that is, that they are interrelated. And finally, he writes that these interrelationships are the result of laws – processes – that operate throughout the natural world.\n\nThis notion of these interrelationships is so important to the study of the environment that it is worth pausing to examine it in a little more detail.\n\nIf a bird in Darwin's hedgerow – say, a robin – eats an earthworm, that's an interaction between the bird and the worm. This interaction has consequences for the bird (a good meal) and rather drastic consequences for the worm (the end of its life). If the worm is to live and play its part in producing another generation of worms, it must avoid being eaten by the robin. But the relationship has implications in both directions. If the bird is to live and help to produce the next generation of robins, it must find and eat a certain number of worms (and other things). This set of interactions produces a link, an interrelationship, between robins and worms.\n\nOf course, the robin and the earthworm will interact with many other living things in many other ways at the same time. The robin will use plant material from the hedgerow to construct its nest, will compete with other robins for territory and mates, and may itself end up as a meal for a sparrowhawk or a cat.\n\nThe bird and the worm also depend on, and change, the physical environment of the hedgerow. For example, the bird needs oxygen from the atmosphere and its droppings add chemicals to the soil. The worm extracts nutrients from the soil, and alters its consistency by passing it through its body as it feeds. This makes it easier for the roots of the hedgerow's plants to find the water and the nutrients they need, and so on. It is already easy to see that the interrelationships in our ‘entangled bank’ are more complicated than we might have thought, and that they involve both the living and the non-living components of the ecosystem.",

    "bitmark": "[.article:bitmark--]\n[@id:135597]\nDoes all this matter? Why is it important to divide the biosphere into ecosystems and study the interrelationships they contain?\n\nMy first answer would have something to do with the wonder and fascination of nature itself. For me, and for many other people I suspect, what science can tell us about how the biosphere works – about the interrelationships involved – serves to make it more interesting and more beautiful.\n\nThere is, however, another pressing reason to study ecosystems. Preserving the ecosystems of the Earth, and their ability to sustain us, is now our responsibility. It is time to put ourselves back into the picture. If asked, we define ourselves in terms of nationality or employment or social class. But we belong to ecosystems as well, and the adaptability of human beings means that we can be found in all sorts of environments from the poles to the equator.\n\nAs we have seen, all living things shape – and are shaped by – the physical environments that they inhabit. But no other species has our capacity to alter the world around it, to maximise the exploitation of its resources. And our influence is now global: modern patterns of business, food distribution and the use of natural resources mean that most of us have an indirect influence on ecosystems across the world.\n\nThe ways in which we have altered the ecosystems of the world include:\n\n• the use of biological resources, from hunting and fishing to cutting down forests\n• the use of physical resources, such as quarrying for rock and diverting water for irrigation systems\n• the use of energy resources, including the burning of wood and fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas)\n• the creation of artificial ecosystems, such as agricultural land for food production, and towns and cities as places for us to live.\n\nThe human population continues to grow and this, combined with the pressure for economic growth and development, will tend to increase our demands on other living things and the physical environment. To manage – or protect – an ecosystem we need to know how the living things it contains depend on each other, and how they depend on the air, soil and water in which they live. In large part, this means understanding the interrelationships involved, and so recognising the consequences of our actions for the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIt is time to introduce a new term into our examination of ecosystems: **ecological health**. This term has become increasingly popular in discussions about the environment, although it is difficult to define or measure with any accuracy. It is possible to identify specific changes to an ecosystem, but any evaluation of its health is a matter of judgement not fact. Who decides whether an ecosystem is healthy? And on what grounds? Is a desert as healthy as a rainforest? Or does ecological health simply depend on a lack of human interference?\n\nThe fact that we find it hard to define ecological health doesn't mean that it has no value as a concept. We find it hard to define human health, but we recognise that it is important none the less. We know that some individuals are healthier than others and that certain things – a poor diet, for example – can have a negative effect. Like human health, ecological health is best thought of as a combination of many different things: the diversity, numbers and condition of the living organisms in an ecosystem; the complexity of the food webs involved; and the quality of the air, soil and water that make up the physical environment.\n\nWe need to study the health of ecosystems to find out how to protect them. How much change has already taken place? What will be the long-term consequences of our actions? How can we increase an ecosystem's ability both to resist change (**ecological resistance**) and to recover from the changes that have already happened (**ecological resilience**)?\n\nWe are the most powerful actors in most ecosystems, yet until recently we have been largely unaware of the ecological consequences of the way we live our lives. A quick glance through the newspapers, however, indicates that we are now becoming increasingly concerned about our collective impact on ecological health, in terms of pollution, climate change and the use of finite biological and physical resources.",

      "body": "Does all this matter? Why is it important to divide the biosphere into ecosystems and study the interrelationships they contain?\n\nMy first answer would have something to do with the wonder and fascination of nature itself. For me, and for many other people I suspect, what science can tell us about how the biosphere works – about the interrelationships involved – serves to make it more interesting and more beautiful.\n\nThere is, however, another pressing reason to study ecosystems. Preserving the ecosystems of the Earth, and their ability to sustain us, is now our responsibility. It is time to put ourselves back into the picture. If asked, we define ourselves in terms of nationality or employment or social class. But we belong to ecosystems as well, and the adaptability of human beings means that we can be found in all sorts of environments from the poles to the equator.\n\nAs we have seen, all living things shape – and are shaped by – the physical environments that they inhabit. But no other species has our capacity to alter the world around it, to maximise the exploitation of its resources. And our influence is now global: modern patterns of business, food distribution and the use of natural resources mean that most of us have an indirect influence on ecosystems across the world.\n\nThe ways in which we have altered the ecosystems of the world include:\n\n• the use of biological resources, from hunting and fishing to cutting down forests\n• the use of physical resources, such as quarrying for rock and diverting water for irrigation systems\n• the use of energy resources, including the burning of wood and fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas)\n• the creation of artificial ecosystems, such as agricultural land for food production, and towns and cities as places for us to live.\n\nThe human population continues to grow and this, combined with the pressure for economic growth and development, will tend to increase our demands on other living things and the physical environment. To manage – or protect – an ecosystem we need to know how the living things it contains depend on each other, and how they depend on the air, soil and water in which they live. In large part, this means understanding the interrelationships involved, and so recognising the consequences of our actions for the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIt is time to introduce a new term into our examination of ecosystems: **ecological health**. This term has become increasingly popular in discussions about the environment, although it is difficult to define or measure with any accuracy. It is possible to identify specific changes to an ecosystem, but any evaluation of its health is a matter of judgement not fact. Who decides whether an ecosystem is healthy? And on what grounds? Is a desert as healthy as a rainforest? Or does ecological health simply depend on a lack of human interference?\n\nThe fact that we find it hard to define ecological health doesn't mean that it has no value as a concept. We find it hard to define human health, but we recognise that it is important none the less. We know that some individuals are healthier than others and that certain things – a poor diet, for example – can have a negative effect. Like human health, ecological health is best thought of as a combination of many different things: the diversity, numbers and condition of the living organisms in an ecosystem; the complexity of the food webs involved; and the quality of the air, soil and water that make up the physical environment.\n\nWe need to study the health of ecosystems to find out how to protect them. How much change has already taken place? What will be the long-term consequences of our actions? How can we increase an ecosystem's ability both to resist change (**ecological resistance**) and to recover from the changes that have already happened (**ecological resilience**)?\n\nWe are the most powerful actors in most ecosystems, yet until recently we have been largely unaware of the ecological consequences of the way we live our lives.
