[!Design your own Story]
• **Use the questions you ask in your selling process.** These questions already convey your story. Answer all the questions your customers give you and you have a framework ready to go.
• **Start with the problem, the situation, and the emotional state.** Describe what was going on, the concern, personal stress, anxiety,frustration, etc. Use sensory words. The prospect needs to feel and see themselves in the story.
• **Analysis and implementation.** Outline how you analyzed the situation and how you suggested handling the issue. Talk about what had to be done to achieve the solution and in what timeline. Do not lecture, just tell the story to inspire.
• **Outcome.** This is the ‘after’ part of the story, the result. Start with where they came from.
__“So Mike went from 40 kilos overweight, struggling to get around himself every day, to losing not only 40 but 45 kilos, now being not only happy with his weight but also boosted his confidence and is a happier father to his children.”__
• **Moral of the Story.** Why the prospect needs your product or service.
__“That’s why it’s so vitally important to have a good structure in place. Mike could have said, ‘That’s a lot of work’, but if you take into account what Mike had to do before to be happy, it’s a lot less work now.”__

[%][%Additional Tips]
• Use simple and concrete language. Words and terms that make sense and are clear to anyone, and also people without expert knowledge!
• Another tool is the use of metaphors. Using metaphors allows the customer to get it immediately. Especially if you need to explain something technical for instance, try to use simple metaphors.
• To add energy, it is possible to use adjectives and adverbs. Examples are incredibly, rapidly, exciting, extremely, etc. Be careful, overuse these words and you will sound unrealistic.
