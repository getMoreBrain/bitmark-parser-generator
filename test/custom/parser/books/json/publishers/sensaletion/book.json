The urgency for a solution will grow by the increasing number of implications. Why? Because the more issues and implications you uncover, the more reasons the buyer has to buy from you.\n\n\nIt’s pretty simple to uncover implications.

This is how you really get to understand the problem or desire and its emotional influence. These implications are for you to combine with your intangible value. Asking implications also increases the sense of urgency surrounding the issue, which is a good reason to proceed with the purchase.

As important as your product is how you present it to customers. Which is great, because it’s another opportunity for you to make a difference. \n\nThe words we use while we communicate are crucial because __people think in pictures, not in words__. Imagine I told you I bought a fast red car last year. Are you thinking of the letters F A S T  R E D  C A R or did you have an image of a red Ferrari in your mind? Visualization enables humans to make decisions quickly. Therefore we need to frame our story with words that allow people to create clear pictures (H. Kensett).\n\nThe art of storytelling is a fantastic tool for this. A good story will touch the listener's emotions and leave them with a lasting impression. Facts alone will not suffice. A story on the other hand aids in the creation of images, making the story much more memorable for customers. In fact, information presented in the form of a story is 22 times more likely to be remembered than information presented as simple facts. Our brains start to sync up with the storyteller's when we listen to a story; the same brain regions start to fire simultaneously in both of our heads. Another amazing upside is that stories have a direct correlation with trust. And as we know, trust is an extremely important factor that determines the likelihood of doing business with one another. Furthermore, the brain uses the same regions to comprehend stories as it does to comprehend other people, which is another fantastic aspect of stories. Because of this, stories enable the listener to identify with the storyteller and gain a deeper understanding of their \"who,\" \"what,\" and \"why.\" The great thing about stories is that they are usually easier to tell than selling benefits. Benefits lack heart and soul (M. Pollard). Moreover, a story is about the implications, which is crucial in the selling process!\n\n**- Good takeaway is that the more sensory the words, the more the brain engages and thus, remembers.\n\nWhat are sensory words? Words that evoke a sense of a smell for example (e.g. perfume and coffee). Those words cause different areas of the brain to light up than when the same people read non-sensory words (e.g. chair and key).**",

Moreover, a story is about the implications, which is crucial in the selling process!\n\n**- Good takeaway is that the more sensory the words, the more the brain engages and thus, remembers.\n\nWhat are sensory words? Words that evoke a sense of a smell for example (e.g. perfume and coffee). Those words cause different areas of the brain to light up than when the same people read non-sensory words (e.g. chair and key).**",

All you have to do now is find one or two stories that somehow convey the value of what you sell and tell them well. Sounds easy right? Well, for most people it’s not that easy to compile a story just like that. I recommend you to follow the following structure, it should give you an idea of how to start your story.\n\n•1 You ask a lot of questions in your selling process. These questions already convey your story. Answer all the questions your customers give you and you have a framework ready to go. Moreover, rely on previous experiences, successes and testimonials. Those stories lay a good foundation.\n•1 Start with the problem, the situation and the emotional state. Describe the situation, including any worries, personal stress, anxiety, or frustration. The prospect must identify with and recognize themselves in the story.\n•1 Evaluation and implementation. Describe your analysis of the situation and your recommendations for handling it. Discuss the steps necessary to reach the solution and the time frame involved. Just tell the story to inspire, don't lecture.\n•1 The result. When you begin telling the result, it’s good to start with quickly highlighting the problem one more time. “So Mike went from 40 kilos overweight, struggling to get around himself every day, to losing not only 40 but 45 kilos.” Just this doesn’t do it though. You need to include the intangible value as well, the true benefit. “So Mike went from 40 kilos overweight, struggling to get around himself every day, to losing not only 40 but 45 kilos, now being not only happy with his weight but it also boosted his confidence and is a happier father to his children.”\n•1 The lesson of the tale. a justification for why the potential customer needs your product. “That’s why it’s so vitally important to have a good structure in place. Mike could have said, ‘That’s a lot of work’, but if you take into account what Mike had to do before to be happy, it’s a lot less work now.”\n\nAdditional tips to write a good story:\n• The brain is more engaged and therefore more likely to remember words that are sensory-rich. What are sensory words? Words that link readers to the five senses: touch, sight, sound, smell, and taste. Such words cause different areas of the brain to light up compared to reading non-sensory words. Please find Appendix X for a list of sensory words, ready for your to use!\n• Use simple and concrete language. Words and phrases that anyone can understand, even those without specialized knowledge!\n• Using metaphors is another tactic. Customers can understand concepts more quickly when metaphors are used.\n• Adjectives and adverbs can be used to increase energy. Incredibly, rapidly, exciting, extremely, etc. Be careful, overuse these words and you sound unrealistic.",

When someone objects, our natural instinct is to withdraw into ourselves. That’s why we stumble over our words. A key component of objections is emotion. The likelihood of success is influenced by how we collaborate with them. The person who exercises the most emotional restraint in a sales conversation has the best chance of getting the desired result. Because both selling and buying are human processes, your interactions with the buyer will likely be greatly influenced by disruptive emotions.\n\nTo make a comparison, let’s look at the sport and in particular tennis. Roger Federer has ruled men’s tennis for years. So have Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. What do they have in common, besides the obvious fact that they possess great talents, work extremely hard and are committed?

      "body": "The human decision-making process is inevitably accompanied by objections. When someone objects, our natural instinct is to withdraw into ourselves. That’s why we stumble over our words. A key component of objections is emotion. The likelihood of success is influenced by how we collaborate with them. The person who exercises the most emotional restraint in a sales conversation has the best chance of getting the desired result. Because both selling and buying are human processes, your interactions with the buyer will likely be greatly influenced by disruptive emotions.\n\nTo make a comparison, let’s look at the sport and in particular tennis. Roger Federer has ruled men’s tennis for years. So have Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. What do they have in common, besides the obvious fact that they possess great talents, work extremely hard and are committed? They all control their emotions extremely well - especially when tension is the highest! They might yell when they win a point but they never scream when they lose a point.

A ledge is a pause and creates a little room in the conversation. It can be a statement, acknowledgement, agreement or question. This is effective because it is simple.

Acknowledging doesn’t mean agreeing, focus on that you hear the concern.\n\n• How so?\n• I appreciate knowing/hearing/sharing\n• Understandably.\n• That’s why I called.\n• I thought you might bring that up.\n• Good point. I wanted to talk about that.\n• I can see where you're coming from.\n• That's how a lot of people feel.\n• That is reasonable\n\nThis is that moment that you take a break, breath and gain control over your emotions.

Being asked however is different of course.\n\nDon’t be surprised the get questions such as:\n• What distinguishes your product from other products in the market?\n• Why should I pick you over X competitor?\n• What makes you the best?\n\nIt's wise to learn more information rather than pounce on your product's advantages right away. So in your response, pose a query and ask:\n• What degree of product familiarity do you have?\n• What do you know about competitor X?\n• What qualifies as \"the best\"?\n\nNever respond with an elevator pitch. I always like to give my competitor a compliment. I usually say something along the lines of: “Well, I don’t work at Car XYZ but they seem to do pretty well, so I am sure they must be a good car dealer.”\n\nFrom there, you obviously want to position yourself in a good spot. So instead of talking about the competitor, I emphasize what we do better. “Well, you know Mr Mike, there are many car dealers out where you could essentially buy the same car. One approach is to offer a discount. That’s how we take a different approach. I know that when you have an issue with your car at Car XYZ, they work with a partner garage. We don’t do that. We help you out right here at our facility, to ensure you get the best possible service possible. And that’s all included in the price.”\n\nNow you are in a great position to communicate the benefits of your proposed solution. How? Answer the implications (not just the features) that you solve!\n\nIs the competitor cheaper? Own it. \"That's correct. They always are.” You now acknowledge something that the prospect was going to use as an argument against your offer. From there, again, accentuate your value vs pricing. “Although I don't work there, I imagine it to be a good company. What I do know is that we invest more than they do in generating the results our clients need as we handle everything in-house, we don’t outsource and control the quality that you will receive as our customer. Moreover, is a lower price more important to you than a lower overall cost? Because by investing more at the start, you won’t have these expenses: A,B,C (e.g. maintenance). Eventually and essentially saving you money in the long run :)”\n\nLastly, a piece of advice regarding competition: Don’t bad-mouth your competitors, even if they do so about you. Don’t join the mud fight. Customers have enough common sense to understand that trashing your competitor is not a nice thing. It also says something about you and your personality. Would you want to work with such a person/company?",

Being asked however is different of course.\n\nDon’t be surprised the get questions such as:\n• What distinguishes your product from other products in the market?\n• Why should I pick you over X competitor?\n• What makes you the best?\n\nIt's wise to learn more information rather than pounce on your product's advantages right away. So in your response, pose a query and ask:\n• What degree of product familiarity do you have?\n• What do you know about competitor X?\n• What qualifies as \"the best\"?\n\nNever respond with an elevator pitch. I always like to give my competitor a compliment. I usually say something along the lines of: “Well, I don’t work at Car XYZ but they seem to do pretty well, so I am sure they must be a good car dealer.”\n\nFrom there, you obviously want to position yourself in a good spot. So instead of talking about the competitor, I emphasize what we do better. “Well, you know Mr Mike, there are many car dealers out where you could essentially buy the same car. One approach is to offer a discount. That’s how we take a different approach. I know that when you have an issue with your car at Car XYZ, they work with a partner garage. We don’t do that. We help you out right here at our facility, to ensure you get the best possible service possible. And that’s all included in the price.”\n\nNow you are in a great position to communicate the benefits of your proposed solution. How? Answer the implications (not just the features) that you solve!\n\nIs the competitor cheaper? Own it. \"That's correct. They always are.” You now acknowledge something that the prospect was going to use as an argument against your offer. From there, again, accentuate your value vs pricing. “Although I don't work there, I imagine it to be a good company. What I do know is that we invest more than they do in generating the results our clients need as we handle everything in-house, we don’t outsource and control the quality that you will receive as our customer. Moreover, is a lower price more important to you than a lower overall cost? Because by investing more at the start, you won’t have these expenses: A,B,C (e.g. maintenance). Eventually and essentially saving you money in the long run :)”\n\nLastly, a piece of advice regarding competition: Don’t bad-mouth your competitors, even if they do so about you. Don’t join the mud fight. Customers have enough common sense to understand that trashing your competitor is not a nice thing. It also says something about you and your personality. Would you want to work with such a person/company?",
