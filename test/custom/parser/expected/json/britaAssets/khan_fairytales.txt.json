Little Red Riding Hood saw the lovely flowers, and said, “Granny would love some fresh flowers.” Forgetting what she promised her mother, she left the path and went into the woods to pick flowers.\n•.

I bet you think you know everything there is to know about this old tale. But you are so wrong!\n•. Let’s start with that sly old Wolf. He thought he could fool a little old lady like me. I’m sure he thought he’d have an easy meal. I’m just a gentle old woman. I’m polite to everyone I meet. That’s why I invited him in. He thought he’d fooled me with his silly voice, but he hadn’t. That Wolf could never sound like my sweet Little Red. I would recognize her soft, gentle voice anywhere. I didn’t know what the Wolf was planning when I invited him in. But then, I’m sure he didn’t expect this old granny to be just as sly as he was.\n•. The moment he swallowed me whole, I was already planning my escape. When you get to be as old as I am, you look forward to adventure. I knew if I put my mind to it, I’d be back out in no time.\n•. The next thing I knew, there was my granddaughter, Little Red. The Wolf had swallowed her up too.\n•. “Let’s play a game!” I said to Little Red. “Let’s see who can jump the highest.”\n•. Little Red and I started jumping. Oh, did we jump! We jumped and jumped and jumped. What a curious sight it must have been to see that old Wolf’s belly bouncing up and down! He howled and howled. The louder he howled, the harder we jumped. He finally opened his mouth, and out we popped! Then the Wolf ran away as quickly as he could—before we started jumping on top of him as well as inside him.\n•. I was a bit startled as I looked around and saw a man I didn’t recognize. Little Red said he was a woodsman. He took one look at us and fell down to the floor with a thump! I guess seeing an old granny and a young girl pop out of a wolf’s mouth could be shocking. But then, the woodsman jumped up and declared himself a hero. He said he had rescued us. What nerve! He’d already run straight into town and told several people before I could stop him. I tried telling everyone the truth, but you know how it is.
