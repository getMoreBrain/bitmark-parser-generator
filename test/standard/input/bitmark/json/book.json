It was developed under the leadership of ==Thomas Gabathuler==|link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-gabathuler/| of the Swiss EdTech startup ==Get More Brain==|link:https://www.getmorebrain.com/| and published in 2019. The bitmark standard is specifically designed for **interactive learning content** such as quizzes and feedback via stored solutions.\n\nWith bitmark, learning **content is “atomized”**, meaning it is broken down into small, meaningful “bits” suitable for mobile screens (e.g. quizzes, exercises…) and then assembled into a coherent book.\n\nUnlike previous “theory-based” e-learning standards (AICC, SCORM, etc.), bitmark was created **bottom-up** in collaboration with publishers and other EdTech companies, originally out of the practical need to digitize language textbooks."
