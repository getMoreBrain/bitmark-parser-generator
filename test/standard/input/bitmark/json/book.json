If publishers want to offer their customers their own apps for playing out the learning content, they will incur development and maintenance costs in addition to the actual digitization costs (conversion of the learning content into a structured data format). If, on the other hand, the publisher uses third-party-developed learning media/LMS that is proprietary, i.e. based on non-public standards, this results in dependencies — a possible change of provider is associated with high additional costs.\n\nHowever, such a ==lock-in==|link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in| affects not only publishers but also the learners (i.e. the “consumers” of the learning content). As long as schools and publishers rely on proprietary solutions, learners are “trapped” in the application in question. The often very expensive textbooks are not compatible with other learning media/LMS (which may be preferred by the learner), and a manual migration of the content — or even of the learner’s progress, comments, own notes, etc. — to another application is also not possible, or only with a disproportionate effort.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that until now both sides — the publishers and the learners — have largely disdained the digital textbook, true to the German poet Friedrich Schiller’s advice “So Hedge Therefore, Who Join Forever”.\n\n|image:https://docs.bitmark.cloud/bit-books/gmb/bitmark_artikel/web-resources/images/kermit.gif|"
